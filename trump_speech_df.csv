Ohio,Sep21,2020,"Wow, thats a big crowd. This is a big crowd. Thank you very much, everybody. Hello to Swanton and a load to Toledo. Im thrilled to be back in Ohio with thousands of hardworking, loyal, great American patriots  days from now. Can you believe it, 43 days We go to again win Ohio. I understand from Bob Paduchik, you know Bob That were going to win it by more than we did. Whether we win at nine, we won by nine points. I just came into that big, beautiful place. Its got more televisions in any plane in history. Theyve got televisions and closets and bathrooms on the floor, on the ceilings. I just saw that were tied in Ohio. I dont think so  President Trump may have a slim lead in Ohio Theyre not even campaigning in Ohio, come to think of it. Now, theyre fake polls. Theyre almost as fake as the writers themselves. Theyre all fake. Remember last time they said, No, hes going to lose Ohio. We won by nine points. So, we had seven swing states last time. President Trump is going to go home early, but it wasnt president at that time, it was just Donald Trump. He will go home early. We did. That we went home early as victors, but we had nine states. They had one of the crazy papers, New York Times. They hired that guy. They paid him millions because he never predicted wrong. He was wrong. I dont know if they had a contract where they could fire him, but they hired this guy. We had nine states. I was down at all of them on the day of election. I was going to lose all nine, and then guess what I won every one of them. Fake polls. Theyre fake polls. Then we have a crowd like this. I dont know. Look, the cameras, are you turning around These guys are bad people. I swear. They never turn the cameras around, ever. Turn them around. Turn them around. They never tell, look at them. Its just like a bunch of stiffs. Real stiffs. Why dont you turn the cameras around for once You look back there, you cant see it. Theres got to be, feels like Madison Square Garden on the ground except we have more people. Oh boy, its always tough. You know, we go through this all the time. Were always asking them, look at these crowds. I mean, as far, you cant see it. You have this prime territory, like you should be in the real estate business. Now, as far as the eye can see back there, the cameras dont, they dont get it. You only hear it from the sound. I go home. I say to the first lady, Did you see that crowd we had tonight in Ohio She goes, No, no. They just keep it on your face. That includes Fox. They just keep it here, right here. They dont want to show. You know what they dont know and what they dont get is that showing this kind of activity is a good thing for them. Its positive for their ratings. Its really a good thing, but they dont want to do it, but I give up on it. You know what you do You hear it because you cant have  You know when sleepy Joe Biden, hes got the circles. You knowthose big circles You know why he has the circles Hes got four of them, because they cant  I mean, think of it. He is a guy whos failed every time he ran. We called him 1% Joe and now hes shot and he got their nomination. How the hell does that work out How does that work out But hes got the circles. He got like four, sometimes he has six because thats a good way of saying, if you dont have any people, just put them in the circle and hes practicing the science. Now it doesnt work out, but were going to win four more years in the White House. Were doing things that nobodys ever done before. Were doing what nobodys ever done, and thank you for being here. I wish we could move the press back further, if you want to know the truth. As our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice  Thank you everybody. Thank you. So is our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I will soon announce a nominee for the United States Supreme Court. They say its the most important thing a president can do. I dont know. I think military, maybe. We rebuilt your military two and a half trillion dollars. Great. We will fill that seat. Its going to go quickly. Probably announced the person. I dont want to make the men too angry. It will be a woman. Is that okay I dont want to have a problem with men. Theyll say Trump is doing very poorly with men. You listen. Hows he doing Well, hes doing very poorly with men, with women. Hes doing very poorly with the black community, Hispanic community. Then you have the election night doing very poorly with those with diploma, without diploma, college, PhDs. Whats he doing well Oh no, its going to be a very short night. Then they say Donald Trump is the projected winner by a lot. They say, well, what happened is he did very well with women did very well with men, diplomas. He did well with African American community. By the way, we are doing really well with the African American community, with the Hispanic community. Were doing well with women. Were doing very well. Were doing well with suburbia, suburbia. I ended a regulation that will destroy suburbia. If Biden got in, they will destroy the suburbia. We call it suburbia of the world and we love it. I know it well, Westchester County, the suburban, they sometimes, if you say suburban housewife, youre in deep trouble. So what you do is you say suburban women, they love me. You know why They want security and they dont want projects being right next to their house. Thats okay. They dont want it. By the way, that includes minorities. Because 29% to 30% of these suburban communities are minorities. That includes them. They dont want that. They want safe communities. They want great communities. They dont want to lose the American dream. Its very simple. I got rid of the regulation from Obama- Biden that was destroying suburbia. Okay Destroying it. I think suburbia has got to wake up because if they get in, you know whos in charge You know whos in charge of the program Cory Booker, Cory Booker. Cory Booker. So, I think the suburban women and suburban men and husbands and wives and everybody, you better get smart because youre not going to have your dream very much longer if they get in. If I get in, youve got it. Youve also got your second amendment if I get it. In 2018, we expanded the Senate majority. Remember, they said, first of all, I wasnt running. I wasnt running. It makes a difference. Wait you see what happens. Were going to take back the house. Were going to get rid of this crazy Nancy Pelosi. Kevin McCarthys done a great job. Were going to take back the house. People are so tired of her. People are so tired. Did you hear today The latest. So, they impeached me for perfect phone call. Perfect. It was a perfect phone call. Now they want to impeach me again if I nominate somebody as Im constitutionally obligated to do, to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. Go ahead and I want them to do that. I want them to do that. We will. We will. We will. If he puts forth a highly qualified candidate, we will impeach him. Well, I said, Well, Im the only guy in the world that could get impeached for trying to fill a seat in the Supreme. So, were going to put up our nominee whos going to be outstanding. Were looking at five incredible jurists, five incredible people, women that are extraordinary in every way. I mean, honestly, it could be anyone. I mean, were going to be announcing it on Friday or Saturday. Again, they say its the most important thing and think of it. So in a single term, single term, by the end of our term, we will have nominated and had confirmed I think itll end up being over 300 federal judges and hopefully three Supreme Court justices. Think of that. Three. Some presidents, they never get any. They last a long time, a lot of presidents get none. Weve had three. Its blowing their minds. Its blowing their minds, but for the people of Ohio, this is what you want. So, it looks like were going to have three and its going to be very exciting. Its exciting even from me. Im going to look forward to it. Probably Saturday, we will announce the nominee and its somebody that youre going to have great respect for, great respect. Thank you. Big stuff. Thats a big thing. They set the course of our country for many years to come, whether its on life or the second amendment or so many other things, they set the whole course of the country. Very important position, the most important. Joe Biden has refused to list the names of his potential justices because he knows theyre too extreme to withstand any form of public review. If Joe Biden and the Democrats take power, they will pack the Supreme Court with far left radicals who will unilaterally transform American society far beyond recognition. They will mutilate the largest figure the constitution and oppose a socialist vision from the bench that could never pass at the ballot box. So, they dont want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far left radicals. If he does something even towards left of center, which would be acceptable, I guess, we have no choice. If he did that, he would lose the left. So, hes going to have to put in radicals. So he doesnt want to show who his judges are. Ive shown a list, I have a double list, about 45 from which I will only pick, but he doesnt want to do that, because if you found out who he was going to pick, he would be unelectable. Hopefully, hes going to be unelectable anyway. Were going to find out. So, he wouldnt be able to survive a Joe Biden. You wouldnt be able to survive. Weve been calling it socialism. I dont think its socialism. I think its a step beyond what theyre talking about. You look at Portland, you look at Chicago, you look at New York, you look at Baltimore and Oakland. These are Democrat run cities that are horrible in crime. Theres no law and order, no cash bail, no anything. You know what The Republican cities are running great. Theyre running great. So, were going to get it all changed around. We went into Minneapolis, we solved the problem like you wouldnt believe. What did it take You saw it. What did that take I would say probably 30 minutes. Right They should have called us in about seven days earlier. How about the reporter He gets up there, behind him is a burning city. I never saw anything like it. Hes saying, There are really no protests here. This is very friendly. We call this a friendly protester because youre not supposed to have political rallies. Youre not supposed to have anything. The only thing you can have is thousands of people running down a street burning stores, looting, doing what  Thats okay, because thats protesting, but well call this a friendly protest, but your children will be robbed of their future and the damage will endure for generations to come-  future the damage well endure for generations to come. We have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country in my opinion. And a lot of thats got to do with the fact that were going to have one extra, but we didnt think this was going to happen. But I used to say just a week ago, Were going to have one, two, three, four, and maybe even five, the next President, and the Supreme Court is going to be a tremendous factor. A lot of people said thats the reason I won so easily in the Electoral College last time. 306, 306 to 223. He will not get to 270. Remember He will not get to 270. This will be a short evening for Donald Trump. Oh, good riddance. Thank God we got rid of him. Oh, this is going to be great. And then that problem happened. Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. Remember the one, she was crying She was crying. Donald Trump has won Ohio. But it wasnt winning Ohio, it was by the margin. Where the hell he said, Where did this margin come from They opened the polls. Then they closed the polls. Normally you have to wait hours, unless its a total runaway. And they said, Ah, the polls and the doors are closed in Ohio. Donald Trump has won. And they go, Oh my God. But wait a minute. He won by nine points. What the hells going on over here Then they said, Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Donald Trump has won the state of Georgia. Donald Trump has won North Carolina, South Carolina. Remember that Was that the most exciting evening, really Remember And its not Donald Trump. Its you. Its all of us. They use the name Donald Trump. Its all of us have won. And this ones going to be even better because nobody has done, and then dont even challenge it, the fake news, nobody has done in three and a half years what weve done. Weve rebuilt our military. Two and a half trillion dollars. Weve taken care of our vets. We have choice, we have accountability. We can fire people now when theyre not treating our vets right. We couldnt do that before. They could treat our vets terribly. We have accountability. Nobody has done what weve done for our vets. 91% approval rating at the VA. 91%, the highest ever. So nobodys done it, and thats why I think this is going to be the most important of all. I used to say, Well, I dont know. How does it compare to 2016 I just gave that up. This is the most important election. You know why Two reasons. Number one, thats over with, the hell with it. The hell with it. But the truth is its got a seat in, and we have a lot of new things including additional, substantial, middle income tax cuts and other tax cuts, and tremendous regulation cuts. And were finishing up with our military. Were building Space Force. The wall is going incredibly. You remember the wall They dont talk about the wall anymore, the fake news. Once we started building it, if you think that was easy to build the wall, we had an entire party that would die for the fact, and I made a terrible mistake in the wall, instead of telling you, Were going to build a wall, were going to build a wall, the Democrats formed, it was very tough, but I got it. Im a real estate developer. You can always get money. You learn we have a lot of little pockets. We had a lot of big pockets. But the military was great. The Army Corps of Engineers were great. So were up to 330 miles of wall. Were doing 10 miles a week, and were going to be finished with the wall very soon. And its exactly the wall, the little more expensive wall, they want like nice, expensive, but exactly what border patrol wanted. Were building them the exact wall that they want. We cant give them any excuses. We cant give them any excuses. But its true, they used to talk about the wall all the time because they never thought Id be able to get a bill. Once I got it going, got it built, I got the financing, we won a lot of lawsuits, by the way, we won a lot of lawsuits. They sued us. Pelosi was suing us. Congress was suing us. The Senate was suing us. We won a lot of lawsuits. Once it was obvious that we won and we started building, they never talk about the wall anymore. And I made a terrible, terrible mistake because I had to work my ass off to get that thing built. You have no idea. You have no idea. You have no idea. But I should have said, the mistake, I should have said when I talked to these big crowds, and the crowds are getting bigger, theres more enthusiasm now than we ever had four years ago, but I should have said, instead of, We will build a wall, I kept, We will build a wall, place would go crazy, I should have said, We will not build the wall. Under no circumstances, will we build a wall, the Democrats would have given us all the money we wanted. Its true. Its true. And then they would have said, See, he didnt keep his campaign promise. These people are sick. The Biden nominated justices will shred our Second Amendment, eliminate the right to self defense, and allow the government to confiscate your privately owned firearms. You know that. Put in other language, they will end your Second Amendment. And they will do that. By the way, if I wasnt here, you wouldnt have a Second Amendment right now. That would be gone. I hate to say it. Im the only thing standing between you and chaos, Im telling you. And Second Amendment and all of the other things. Bidens justices will remove the words under God from the Pledge of Allegiance. Did you see that Did you see it They said, No, wed never remove. And I saw it, theyre doing the Pledge of Allegiance. And I said, Oh, it must be a typo. They left the words under God out of the Pledge of Allegiance, the Democrats. And I said, Oh, theres a typo. Typo, they made a mistake. What a stupid mistake. Can you believe it That guys in big trouble. What a stupid mistake. And then I heard it a second time. They did the same mistake. Thats what theyre doing. Theyre going to take God out of everything just like they want to knock down the statue of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. Thats never happening. Its never happening. A lot of these Democrats states, you see it, the churches are closed. They dont want our churches to open. You can have a riot where you kill people in the streets. 25,000 people dont have to wear a mask, nothing. They can march down the streets, step on each others face, they can do whatever the hell they want, thats okay. But you cant go to church. They have ideas, they have plans, and its never happening with me as your President. That I can tell you. And you see it, they want to tear down crosses from public spaces. You see it. Since I signed a little law, they were ripping down a lot of statues about four months ago, and I said, Do we have any laws, like old laws when they was strong, when we were smart, when we were tough Sir, we have one, sir. A General came in. Whats the law, General Sir, there was a law from quite a while ago, 10 years in prison. They didnt use the word jail, prison. Prisons a tougher word. I said, What do you mean, 10 years You get 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue or if you knock down a monument. I said, General, let me see that sucker, please. Bring that to my office. And we revived it because you cant get that approved by Congress. They would never. Today in Congress, youd do it, theyll give you half a day in a hotel someplace. So 10 years. So they were having a big march on Washington in two days and I signed this new law. We updated it, and it was 10 years. You get 10 years in prison. You touch, you knock down a monument. And theres no games. This is the old days. This is the days when we had strong laws, when we had real laws, when we had real politicians that knew how to make laws. So heres the thing. So they werent going to come in, they were actually looking to knock down the statue of a man named Thomas Jefferson. Thats not too good. They had obliterated a lot of different things. And so I had a news conference. I announced that Im signing a law that anybody that knocks down a monument or a statue gets 10 years in jail. And the police in Washington, and we had National Guard, we had Secret Service. We were all ready for them. We were ready for them. And the time came, theres was only a problem, nobody showed up. You know why 10 years was too much. 10 years was too much. Its amazing the way. Isnt it amazing the way it all works So instead they burned down Portland. I speak to the Governor. The mayor is hopeless. Hes a hopeless, poor guy. They chased him out of his apartment, and he still thinks theyre wonderful people. Theyre burning down his city. But I want to go in there with the National Guard so bad. It would take us 15 minutes to solve the problem. When they heard in Seattle that we were going in, we were going in the next day, the guys just walked away. They left. That was the end of it. We had nothing to do. But they want to ban all prayer in public schools and require taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion. Bidens justices will erase national borders, they dont want borders, protect sanctuary cities, and compel the unlimited entry of foreign nationals. And if you look at some of these jihadist nations, no thank you. Somebody said, Thats not nice. Thats not politically correct. I said, Thats okay. Theyll clip all the police departments, free violent criminals, shield foreign terrorists, and declare the death penalty unconstitutional, even for the most depraved mass murderers who kill women and children. Thats what they want. They dont want any death penalty. Not for the Boston Bomber, not for anybody. You see the Boston Bomber, theyre still trying this guy, what he did to so many lives. He killed people, ruined so many families, ruined so many lives. And by the way, they want the Boston Bomber to be able to vote. You know that. In three and a half years under my administration, weve secured Americas borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, fixed our disastrous trade deals, and brought jobs and factories back to the great state of Ohio. I love Ohio. I love Ohio. I dont know what it is. I was told by Bob and some of the Congressmen that are here, we have some great ones, Im going to introduce them in a second, but I was told that theyre not even trying for Ohio. You know why Because I love you and you love me, and thats the way it is. Thats the way it is. Thank you. I love you too. Its very interesting. So somebody in the fake news media did a story yesterday because theres crazy chances going on. They have too about the seat and all that. But there was another chant thats happening at all these rallies. Were having massive rallies. Were in Minnesota. We had a tremendous crowd. Wisconsin, tremendous. Pennsylvania, every one of them. I mean, in all fairness, its like this, everyone. But this rant is going on like its crazy. And its, We love you. We love you. We love you, and you know what I dont want to say it. Im just saying, they have not been able to find in the history of politics in this nation, even we loved Ronald Reagan, but they have not been able to find where people broke out and said, We love you, about, I guess I have to call myself a politician. I dont feel like a politician. How nice is that I never heard it. Ive been to a lot of different speeches and rallies. Ive never heard crowds go, We love you. But you know why We love you. I love you. But you know why Because, again, nobody has done what weve done. Ohio had the best year in its history last year. We had a great year. And next year, assuming we win, which I hope were going to win, but if we win, youre going to have a year next year. First of all, take a look at the third quarter. Its going to be announced the numbers just before the election. Theyll come out three days before the election. And Ill tell you what, Ill bet on the numbers, even though Crazy Nancy and these people dont want to give any stimulus, they dont want to give anything. They want to keep a lot of states closed wherever they can. You know what theyre going to do Theyre going to announce theyre going to be opening on November 4th. Therell be open. All these closed states, theyre going to be open on November 4th. One of them blue and a teachers union. Did you see it No, we dont want to open now. We dont want to open. The pandemic. We dont want to. Were rounding the turn on the pandemic. Vaccines are coming soon. But we dont want to open. Around November 4th were going to open. This person thats a judge of a union said that. That was not good. I think theyll get rid of her quickly. Im also proud that we have successfully brought back the Big 10 and the Ohio State Buckeyes. You better have a good year after all of that. You have a good team, right Good coach. Good team. Good everything. You have a good team. You always have a good team. But there was a case, what do I know I said, Hows it going Everything good Are you struggling They said, Sir, Sleepy Joe Biden did an ad that you, me, that you closed football. I said, What do you mean I closed I didnt close. The guy did an ad. Its called disinformation. Its called the opposite of what the fact is. Not only didnt I close it, I didnt think about it too much, okay The states should all be open. But I heard about Big 10 football, and because of this ad, I said, Hey, wait a minute. I have an idea. It was a fake ad, just like the ad on the grave sites, and that allows me to say that this man is a gross incompetent. He has no idea. Because now, see, I would never talk like that, but when I saw that horrible thing, and nobodys done more for the military than I have, when I saw that horrible ad, An anonymous source has said that Donald Trump said this, I have 28 people now that have come forward saying its a total lie, they dont care, so they did an ad, once they did that, I said, Well, now the gloves are off. Lets face it, Joe Biden is incompetent. He always was even in prime time. he was incompetent in prime time. And now hes really incompetent. But because of the ad, I said, Its very interesting, that ad, its very interesting. Let me call up the Commissioner. I had called up the Commissioner, very good guy, and I said, Commissioner, what can we do to get Big 10 football back Well, I dont know. And we started a little thing, the Commissioner and myself, one of my guys, hes fantastic, and within a few days, it started getting talked about, and then we kept it going and we helped him with some testing because we have the greatest testing in the world. We get no credit for it. Weve tested almost 100 million people. India is second with 38th and they have 1.5 billion people, slightly more than you. But I will tell you, so all of a sudden they have schools. Then looked like it was going to open without Michigan and without a couple of states. And then all of a sudden the pressure became so great, and the full league is opening now and its going to be very exciting. And I will tell you, its not a question of taking credit, but truly we were the ones that did that. I mean, it was. Ill tell you when I do it and when I dont. But it was closed, it was gone, it was announced that it was closed. And what really spurred me on was when Sleepy Joe announced that I was the one that did it. I said, I didnt even know it was closed. But once I found out it was, I called the Commissioner. He was really good, I tell you. And we called a couple of the top people at the universities and they got it going. It looked like we had seven schools, eight schools. All of a sudden, everybody fell into line. I think theyre all open now. Every one of them is participating. So I want to thank the Commissioner. I want to thank all of those schools. May the best team win. In other words, Ohio State. Thats a good team. You know who the best proponents were The players and especially the parents of the players. These kids have a short window to get into the NFL to create some excitement and how good they are. And you have a lot of potential players, but they couldnt play football. And they said, Were safer on the field than we are staying at home, and they meant it. And we did something and Im happy about it. So enjoy the football, enjoy it. Under 16 years of Presidents Obama and Bush, median household income rose only 2,945. So remember that. Thats 16 years, 2009, so lets say 3000. Under three years of President Trump, it rose almost 7,000. So think of that, 16 years. Three years, achieving the highest median income in the history of our country. In my first three years, we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any President in the history of our country. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world and we are doing it again. Were building it again. I see the signs Make America Great Again, so I say this, its called now Make America Great Again. Again. Because we did it and then we had to close it up. We saved millions of lives. If we didnt do that, you would have had three million people. It would have been terrible. Its terrible anyway. They shouldnt have allowed it to happen, China. To defeat the China Virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War Two. Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate- Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that. Thats remdesivir and all of the things, the plasma, all different things. Where do you see whats coming out Europe is almost 30% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. Thats before todays big breakout. You know they had a big breakout in Europe and they keep saying in the fake news, they keep saying about, Oh, Europe, Europe, Europe. Well, were doing better than Europe. I hate to see what happened, and it had a big impact on the market today because it was a bad thing. But they had a big hit and theyll take care of it. They know how to do it. Theyll take care of it. Were working very closely with Europe and other countries, including on the vaccine. We have three vaccines right now that are right there. Theyre right at the starting gate and theyre going to be fantastic. So its good. With Biden, if you had that regime, youd be three years away because it would have never gotten out of the FDA. What weve done in a very safe manner is amazing. Now remember this, Biden was in charge of the swine flu, right Its called the H1N1. Remember he calls it the N1H1. I said, No, no, no, no. H comes before the N. Its so easy. But he goes, The N1H1. We say, No. But its the swine flu. Maybe we just call it the swine flu. He did such a gross, horrible job on that. His own man who was in charge of it said they didnt have a clue. They didnt know what they were doing. It was a much less lethal disease and they lost many, many people. Many, many people. It was totally incompetently. And now I got this guy standing up. Well, were giving him advice. His own guy that ran it. Did everybody see this Theyre saying they didnt have a clue what they were doing. It was so bad. I dont know why the hell he said it, to be honest with you. Who would say that Maybe because he was honest. Does that make sense Now Biden gets up and hes saying to do the same things as weve already done. He basically took our plan and he said, This is what you should do. But we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world and the fastest economic recovery by far of any Western nation by far. Our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs, including 1.9 million jobs in the state of Ohio. You know that He knows it. Hes got one of them. Hes got one of them. Through operation warp speed, were developing these great vaccines. And thats going to be Literally, these will be done in record time. Like nobodys ever done it before. On November 3rd, Ohio will decide whether we end the pandemic and return to record prosperity or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden and his group of incompetence to delay the vaccine, shut down the country. He actually suggested that he would shut down the country. We now know the disease. We didnt know it. Now we know it affects elderly people with heart problems and other problems. If they have other problems, thats what it really affects. Thats it. You know, in some States, thousands of people, nobody young below the age of 18, like nobody. They have a strong immune system. Who knows Take your hat off to the young because they have a hell of an immune system, but it affects virtually nobody. Its an amazing thing. By the way, open your schools. Everybody open your schools. Sleepy Joe Biden wants to impose a 4 trillion tax site, ban American energy, destroy the suburbs, give free healthcare to illegal aliens. How about that one You know the bad part about that We all have heart. We want to take care of people. Probably that is everybodys going to come to the United States. People that werent even thinking about it, theyre going to say, Oh man, these idiots are giving free healthcare, free college education. Theyre giving free everything. Theyre giving a Rolls Royce to every family that enters through the Southern border. Remember I said that jokingly and CNN said, He misrepresented. They are not getting a Rolls Royce. I agree. Now theyre sick. They are sick. And indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies. Theyre doing that. Were stopping it. To combat the toxic left-wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that were launching a pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and we are getting better and better all the time. We got to. No party can lead America that will not teach our children to love America. Bidens running mate, Kamilla. Who likes Kamilla Does anybody like her She was the most failed candidate. I mean, she started off good. And every week she went down, down 15 points, 12 points, 11 points, 9 points, six points, five points, four points, two points. Didnt she leave at about two or one She was heading down to the basement. She was so mean to him. I felt sorry for him. No, I did. I felt sorry. So she called them everything from a racist to a MeTooer. He was MeToo. He was a part of the MeToo generation. What she called him, what she said. So I brilliantly said, Well, he cant pick Pocahontas because she was too nasty. How nasty was she to Bloomberg Was she unbelievable Boy, he was standing there. What happened What happened No, actually. What happened Mini Mike. Hes another beauty. Hes a real beauty. Mini Mike, what happened What the hell happened He hit her so hard. Remember She hits him with about 30 different things, and Im not talking about our president. He thought she was talking about me. Can you believe it And Im not talking. Im talking about you. He said, Get me out of here. Get me out of here. And now he wants to buy his way back into the Democrat party. He wants to buy his way back into the Democrats. He hasnt taken enough abuse. If I were him, Id sort of either ride it out or stay with the good Trump economy and get even richer. Bidens running made even urged supporters to help the bail riders out of jail. You saw that Including one who attempted to murder a police officer and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight year old child. Now theyre trying to free them on bail. Theyre putting up the money to get them out by this plan to appease the domestic terrorist. And thats what it is. My plan is to arrest the domestic terrorist, and thats what were doing for many people in jail. Many people. Remember what I told you about the monuments This is remembrance. Isnt it beautiful We dont see that anymore. Have you seen a monument knocked down recently No, we dont see it anymore. I dont know. We want to rip down Abraham Lincoln. It got to Lincoln. First, it was not too many people heard of him. Confederate soldiers, et cetera. You say, Hey, look, do it through a process. But they started hitting Lincoln. Then they hit Gandhi. Now Gandhi was about peace. Gandhi just wanted peace. Leave me alone. Peace, peace, peace. Lets rip them down. Theyre sick people. The Democrat partys war on cops has already led to a surge in vicious murders in Democrat control cities costing countless black lives. If Biden and the left gain power, they will dismantle police departments nationwide. Ill tell you, the community thats most hurt, most hurt by what theyre doing and there is the black community, the Hispanic community. And were doing great in the polls with the black community and the Hispanic community. And the Asian community. Were doing great. In fact, we did so well last night on one poll, they said it must be a typo. They did. It must be an error. It wasnt. Its no error. Youre going to find out on November 3rd its no error. As president, I always stand and I will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. Theyre great people. Theyre very brave people. Not easy, and they dont get support. We have to give them back their dignity. We have to let them do their job. Thats very simple. Theyre great. Were joined tonight by two high school football players. They became very, very famous. They became more famous than President Trump. They were beautiful. I watched them running through the crowds with those flags. Heres some place, I dont know, you got a lot of people here.

How are we doing, Jane Hows it going How does it compare to four years ago, Jane Up higher. All right. Good. Good. I think we are. I think we are. A friend of mine that Ill tell you, this is the greatest optimist. When I thought we had to be down, we lost a lot of the top, top support. The head of the Republican party, little things like that. I said, We dont have a head of the Republican party. He left because you had a terrible governor in this state. Terrible. Your previous governor was terrible. He was terrible. Ill tell you, I got this man. I didnt know him. Within about a week, I said, Man, this guys a big optimist. And he was right. He called it right to the thing. He ran my campaign. When he came back for the second time, we had him in a high position. I said, Bob, I think youre great. Youre doing a great job. I want you back in Ohio. We have to do it again. Bob Paduchik. Wheres Bob Thank you. Thank you, Bob. Get over here, Bob. Thank you, Bob. He wants no glamor. He wants no glory. He just wants to win. He called it right down to the bone. We had a rough couple of days. I said, Bob, how we doing You went up two points. I said, You got to be kidding. But we did. So much evolves around Ohio and its just a state that we have a relationship with. Its a great state. Weve done a great job for you and youve done a great job for us. So we appreciate it very much. Thank you. Together, weve spent the last four years reversing the damage done by the Democrats and Joe Biden over a 47 year period. Think of it. Hes always talking about, You should have done this. You should have done that. He really just left office. Its not that long ago, right Hes been there for years and years and now he should have done. Hes never going to do anything. Hes never going to do anything. Guy is a stone cold loser. Biden supported every globalist sellout of Ohio workers for over a half a century, including NAFTA, Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization, the disaster known as TPP and how about the Paris Climate Accord Thats another beauty. Ill tell you, that was designed to hurt our country. You would have lost trillions of dollars, closed your factories all over the place. In the meantime, China didnt kick in for another 10 years. The whole thing was a rigged deal. I tell you, I said, Im going to get killed for this one, but were going to terminate. And you know what The people got it right away. Everybody understood. That was another rip off of our country. This state lost one in three manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA and China disasters. Joe Biden is a shameless phony who pretends He doesnt have a clue. What the hell Were talking like he knows. Hes got guys around him that are pretty smart. Theyre radical left. Hes going to do whatever they tell him to do. He pretends to care about blue collar workers. After spending more than five decades in Washington, he tells me, Why didnt you do this Why didnt you do that You see these fake commercials. Why didnt you do it I said, Ive only been here three and a half years. This guy has been here for 47 years. He didnt do anything. My actions saved countless jobs across Ohio and here in Toledo, the home of the Jeep, right The home of the Jeep. Thats good. Thats a great brand. Theyve done a great job with Jeep. Jeep. Everyone loves Jeep. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to Ohio when we ended the NAFTA nightmare. I proudly signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement in July. Thats a big difference. Like day and night. Its working out great too. Its working out great. You know how I know that its a good deal for us Because they dont like it. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to Chinas rampant theft of Ohio jobs. We achieved American energy. We passed record tax cuts and regulations. Our energy independence is incredible. We have now energy independence. We dont have to be in these far away lands anymore. Now well be there to help certain allies that have been great, but we dont have to be. Since my election, natural gas production in Ohio has surged 63%. They want to close it up. By the way, you do know they want to close it up. They want to close up all fracking natural gas ever. They want to close it up. This would kill at least 700,000 Ohio jobs. Probably more than a million. While Im president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas and Ohio workers will continue leading the way. I just left the great state of Texas, and I talked to a lot of people like this, a great crowd of people. We have tremendous support all over the country. Ill tell you what. These people are great. And heres the platform that they have. Sleepy Joe Biden. No oil, no religion, no God, and no guns. Now Im in Texas. Its a really rough thing in Ohio, but now were talking Texas. No oil, that doesnt work well in Texas, right No guns. That doesnt work well in Texas. No God. Look what theyre doing to the churches and everything. That doesnt work. No God. No religion. That doesnt work well. You would have to be George Washington with your running mate would be Abraham Lincoln. Okay. Your VP candidate. And youd still lose very big. And then they say-  and youd still lose very big. And then they say, Yeah, hes doing okay. Hes two up in Texas. They said it last time too, that Texas is even, four years ago. And everybody said, No, I think Trump is killing it. Wed have stadiums with 25,000, 30,000 people, much more that couldnt get in. Wed have 40,000, 50,000 people outside and theyd say I was even. We won in a landslide, just like we won this state, in a landslide. You know the expression they use, Texas is in play. You know what in play means It could go either way. And guys would get on there and say, I dont think so. And then that night again, The polls in Texas have closed. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas. I mean, the whole thing is crazy. Its crazy, its crazy. You know what they do Its suppression polls. They try and depress you. They try and make you unhappy so you go out to dinner with your wife, your husband, you go out to dinner, Darling, lets have dinner. Its so sad. We love Donald, but he just cant make it. He cant make it. Lets go out, have dinner. Well come home and watch the results. Except 2016 came and nobody did that, they all went out and voted and we kicked ass. Tell me, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television Did you ever see the ratings, the combined ratings I think the biggest ever. But was that the most exciting 2016, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television We invested 2.5 trillion in the U.S. military, including more than 6 billion in contracts. Ill tell you what, you like the word pronounced Lima or Lima, because I saved Lima. And I tell you what, I saved Lima. I came here and they were going to close that plant in Lima. They were going to close the tank plant. It was done. And I said, Why are we closing a tank plant And I got a couple of calls from my friends, the Congressman right here. And I got calls. And Jim Jordan called me. Do you like Jim Jordan Hes great. And I looked at this army tank plant in Lima. I said, Why are we closing it And I saw the people building the tanks and the technologys incredible. And if you ever closed it, youd never be able to open a thing like that again. So I overrode the generals, I overrode everybody, and now were making a record number of tanks in that plant and its absolutely thriving. But we had tremendous success. We took 100% of the ISIS caliphate and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. We took out the worlds number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many other people. Qasem Soleimani is dead. Hes dead. I withdrew from last administrations disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. They paid 150 billion, plus 1.8 billion in cash. You know they got Nothing. They got nothing. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Every president for many, many decades said they were going to do it. They never did it. They never did it. They didnt have the guts to do it. They campaigned on it, they were all going to do it. Then they got there, there was a lot of pressure put on them. A lot of pressure put on me. Every leader was calling all over. Please dont do it. Please dont do it. Mr. President, please dont do it. Dont do it. Dont move it. Just leave it the way it is. Its okay. But I promised and I said, Im going to do it. And then I got calls from the biggest people in the world. Kings, I got calls from presidents, from prime ministers, Please, please dont tell it. Then I got calls, Please have him call me back me, me. I said, Look, tell everybody Im out for three days. Im not going to be able to call them back. I had a news conference, we announced it. Then I called everybody back. Hey, how you doing Hows everything going Everything going good Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you about Israel, but its too late. You already did it. And we did it and we got it done and nobody else got it done. And its something we had to do. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. And instead of endless wars, we are forging peace all over the Middle East. And you saw that. And Im the only man that got nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and I didnt get any press. They wouldnt. For two of them. Last week, Im not bragging about it, Im just saying, Im the President of the United States because of Kosovo-Serbia, theyve been killing each other for years, I worked out a deal for them. I got nominated. And then Israel with Bahrain and UAE, and many more to come. I mean, they all want to do it. Well have peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand. No blood. Were going to have peace in the Middle East. So I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. And I told this story last night. Should I tell it or not Should I Yes. She wants me to do it. So I go home to our great First Lady. I said, First Lady, youre going to be so proud of me tonight. I was nominated not once but twice for totally separate events by different people. Great people. First lady, I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. I was like this. I was nominated. Its a big deal for our country, right And she said, Oh, thats good. I said, Lets turn on the evening news. Lets watch it. This is going to be a big show tonight. Get ready. And NBC, which is one of the most crooked, one of the worst newscasts, and Im talking about normal NBC, not MSDNC. MSDNC is the worst. So I turned on NBC with Lester Holt, another beauty. And they start with a hurricane and then they went to something, and something else. And Im saying, First Lady, this is getting a little embarrassing. Were 20 minutes into a half hour show. They havent mentioned the Nobel Peace Prize. And then it went through the whole show and they never mentioned. Then I got nominated for a second one. They never mentioned. And when Barack Obama, Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, now when Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, he didnt know why he was nominated. It was like right at the very beginning. He didnt do anything. He did nothing and he got nominated. It was the biggest story Ive ever seen. But thats okay. In the meantime, were President and theyre not. No, thats right. You would think if you nominated for the Nobel Prize, youd get maybe half a second. The First Lady, she said, Sorry, darling. Thats the way it goes, isnt it Joe Biden opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He voted for the Iraq War disaster. He backed the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. And he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for our country. Oh, its really great. If it were up to Sleepy Joe, bin Laden and Soleimani would be alive today, ISIS would be on a rampage, Iran would control the Middle East, and China would be the dominant power anywhere in the world. And I want to tell you, if you go back a few months before this pandemic, we were gaining, gaining, gaining. We had an insurmountable lead on China. I always heard they were going to catch us by 2019 for 10 years. We were so far beyond, we were doing much better than they were. The Biden agenda would obliterate our economy. He destroyed social security, destroyed protections for pre-existing conditions. Thats what hes going to do, drain your Medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants. He would end our travel ban to jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by, listen to this, over 700%. And this is the manifesto with Bernie Sanders, with Crazy Bernie. He made this deal with Crazy Bernie. And by the way, a lot of the Crazy Bernie voters last time, four years ago, voted for Trump because of trade, because the one thing they do understand, that our country has been off for years. Biden opposes school choice and vowed to ban charter schools. Very important to have them. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. Theyre totally against it. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just, in conclusion, first of all, its been a great honor to be with you. This is, really, its a great state. Theyre great people. I really mean it. No, I really mean it. Get out there on November 3rd. Weve got to win this one big. This is a bad, bad ideology. This is probably a step beyond socialism. I really think in many ways, its communism were talking about. This is a step beyond. Socialisms no good. Communisms really bad. But get out there on November 3rd and lets show him your stuff and show them the stuff of all of us. So, in concluding, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end the reliance, this ridiculous, crazy reliance on China, and all of these far away lands once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police. And by the way, thank you, police. Thank you, law enforcement. Increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, stupid, endless, foreign wars. We will maintain Americas unrivaled military. Our military might has never been like it is right now because of what weve done. And we had no choice, and hope to God we never have to use it, because if you would ever see the power of what weve done over the last three years, its almost better for you not to see it. We are the envy of every power, every country in the world. We have weapons that nobody ever even thought possible. And just as I said, hope to God we never have to use them. And the way we dont have to use them is to keep that kind of strength. Nobodys going to be talking to us. Were going to have peace through strength, and its all made in the U.S.A. Made in the U.S.A. Well end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. Ive already signed it into law. Kicks in on January 1st. Its going to cut your bills down to a level that you wouldnt believe. That doesnt mean the drug companies and the hospital and corporations are happy with me. But thats okay. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs by 50%, 60% and 70%. Big pharma does not like me too much. Theyre taking ads about me that are so bad, but you get it, you understand it. Theyre not too thrilled with me, including the rebates. The rebates go back to you. The rebates before went back to very rich people. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. Thats whats happening. NASA is again the leading space station anywhere in the world. Theres nothing like a space center, what weve done. And there was grass growing in the runways when I took over three and a half years ago. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust. For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great state of Ohio. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, get everybody, and get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. And in your state, in Ohio, early voting has already begun and dont wait. And when you see them cheating on the other side, I dont say if, when, when you see them cheating with those ballots, all of those unsolicited ballots, those millions of ballots, youll see them, anytime you do, report them to the authorities. The authorities awaiting and watching. From Akron to Columbus, from Cincinnati to Queen City, I know it weller than Cleveland, and from Dayton to Toledo, we inherit the legacy of generations of Ohio patriots, like Neil Armstrong, Annie Oakley, William McKinley, and the amazing Ulysses S. Grant, thats good. Nobodys stock has gone up like Grant. Nobody in the last 10 years. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and you havent seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Ohio, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Get out and vote. Thank you."
BattleCreek,Dec19,2019,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to Vice President Pence. Hes a good guy. Weve done a great job together. And Merry Christmas, Michigan. Thank you, Michigan. What a victory we had in Michigan. What a victory was that. One of the greats. Was that the greatest evening But Im thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of Christmas, the greatness of America and the glory of God. Thank you very much. And did you notice that everybody is saying Merry Christmas again Did you notice Saying Merry Christmas. I remember when I first started this beautiful trip, this beautiful journey, I just said to the First Lady, You are so lucky. I took you on this fantastic journey. Its so much fun. They want to impeach you. They want to do worse than that. By the way, by the way, by the way, it doesnt really feel like were being impeached. The country is doing better than ever before. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong. And we have tremendous support in the Republican Party like weve never had before. Nobodys ever had this kind of support. But this sacred season, our country is thriving and its thriving truly like it has never, it has never happened before to the extent whats happening now. And by the way, your state, because of us, not because of local government, but because of us, because of the job that weve done. Because I understand shes not fixing those potholes. Thats what the word is. It was all about roads and they want to raise those gasoline taxes on you. We dont want to do that. But shes not fixing the potholes. But Michigans had the best year its ever had. Best year its ever had. And thats because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and theyre coming in from Japan and theyre coming in from a lot of other places. Look whats happening. And you know, I dont know if you know this, but probably 10 years ago I was honored. I was the Man Of The Year by I think somebody, whoever. I was the Man Of The Year in Michigan. Can you believe it Long time. And that was long before I ever decided to do this. I was happy. I had a beautiful life. What the hell did I do this for But look how were doing. Do we love it I love it. But anyway, I was the Man Of The Year and probably close to 10 years ago and I came to Michigan. He said, Youre still the Man Of The Year. Thank you. Who said that Thank you. So I came in and I remember the speech so well. I said, Why are you allowing them to steal your car companies Why are you allowing them to go to Mexico and to go from China where they come in from China, they build them in China, they sell them into our country with no tax and you lose your jobs, you lose your factories, the companies leave and you get nothing. Why are they lying I asked that a long time ago and we stopped it. Weve stopped it. And you see that. And we just made the USMCA. Were getting rid of NAFTA, which I think is the worst trade deal ever. And its very exciting. Its a great deal. Its a great deal. Its going to stop exactly what we were just talking about. It makes it very, very prohibitive. They can do it, but theyve got to pay a hell of a big price to do it. And history has proven that stops them. But we have a great USMCA that we negotiated with Mexico, with Canada. Now, from the standpoint of the farmers, you know whats going on. We had tremendous trade barriers in Canada. We had attacks on dairy products, 297% tariff, nobody talked about it, with Canada. And we had some really bad things with Mexico. We now have a wonderful deal. And if we didnt have a good deal, you know what I would have done what What I would have put tariffs on both countries and that would have been it, right That would have been it. Unfortunately the deals been sitting with Nancy Pelosi for a long time and what happened And she had a lot of pressure, especially from manufacturing areas, farm areas, a lot of pressure to sign it. So heres what happens. So I get along with labor. I had a lot of union labor vote for me, tremendous amount of labor. In New York where I come from, we have a lot of unions. And thats okay. Thats fine. So we left a little stuff for the union because we figured to get it signed, well give a little bit and we did it and we have one great deal. And now you have the Democrats trying to take credit for this deal and thats okay. Whatever it takes. For seven months, it sits. They dont do anything. We give. And by the way, I spoke to the unions the day before I say, Fellows, you got to get it done. And union labor loves me and I love you too sir. I love you too sir. So we have a great deal with Mexico, with Canada. And it is true. I say it out loud because I say it to them right now. If they ever wanted to break the deal, thats okay. If somebody wants to break a deal with me, you always have to have an alternative, right And this country, the deals we made, we did a deal with South Korea. Thats great. We did a deal with Japan, 40 billion dollar deal with Japan. It was just a little piece of a deal. Okay That was a piece of a deal. And I said to Japan, Look, you got to make this deal or were going to put a 20% tariff on the cars. And thats more money than anything were talking about. Thats all right. Thats all right. Thats all right. Get her out. Ger her out of here. Oh well. Youre about to hear the greatest speech youve ever heard. And thats going to be the publicity because all the fake news back there will say massive riot Massive riots. Fake news. But seriously, look, look, look, they wont say it. They wont say it, because when we have protesters all in favor, they dont talk about it, but theres a slob. Theres a real slob. Wait, wait a minute. Shell get hell when she gets back home with mom. But she made Look, she screams a little bit. And you know what I like to do Avoid them. Because Ill tell you the big problem. I could hardly hear her. What happens is all of you people go crazy. Look, look, look, and the place. Okay, so theres one disgusting person who made Wait, wait, who made a I wouldnt say this, but made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger right Now they wont say that, the fake news, they wont say it. If one of us did that, it would be like the biggest story ever. I think its terrible. And Ill tell you the other thing, I dont know who the security company is, but the police came up, but they want to be so politically correct so they dont grab her wrist lightly and get her out. They say, Oh, would you please come Would you please come with me Sure. Maam, would you And then she gives the guy the finger and he, Oh, Oh. You got to get a little bit stronger than that, folks. And they . Making another group of tariffs, seven and a half percent. This gives us a lot of currency to do the phase two deal, which they want to start, but were taking in billions of dollars and to help the farmers who were targeted, 16 billion and 12 billion the previous year, helps the farmers. So you know what we do, out of that big check that we get, all that money flows into the treasury. Out of the big check, we gave the farmers 16 billion dollars and 12 billion for the previous year. And you know, the incredible thing, and I was with a lot of farmers. I was with a group of 36 farmers at the White House. You know what they said to me I said, Dont worry about it. Were going to take care of you guys. And I used a bad word. You know what word I used Were going to get you a subsidy. And they said this two years ago, I said, How much were you targeted for This was the first year. 12 billion, sir. The second year was 16. They were target. Thats what they didnt get from China. So I said, Its all right, were going to give you a subsidy of the same and were going to take it out of the tariffs and were going to have billions and billions of dollars left over. And they said, Sir, we dont want money. We just want a level playing field. Ive never seen that before. Ive never seen that before. So we will have invested in our military, since Im here, which is less than three years. Our military, by the way, in all due respect to the previous two administrations, our military was depleted. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. We had fighter jets that were 35 years old. We had planes that were 60 years You heard where the father flew them, the grandfather flew them, and now the young son comes in. Weve got the best equipment in the world now. Spent two and a half trillion dollars, made in the USA. Two and a half trillion. We will shortly. Thatll be all finished. Were going to have the greatest Now we have the best planes. Were going to have the best ships. Were building a lot of ships now. Were building the most powerful weapons in the world. Now, we dont want to even talk about it. We never want to use them. But you know, the way were not going to have to use them is if we have them. Were building submarines, the power of which nobodys ever seen before. Nobodys ever seen before. Its funny, we have these companies come in. I like to make good deals. You like to make good deals. Thats what we do, right So these really countries that come in, prime ministers, presidents, sometimes dictators, those we cant deal with too much. Sir, wed like to buy a nuclear submarine. I say, No thanks. I turn them all down. You have no idea how many people But were building some of the Theyre the most powerful weapons ever made by man or womankind. I say mankind and womankind. They can definitely fight. Theyre the real deal. These guys, so good looking. I said, You could be a movie star. Go to Hollywood. No sir. I like doing what Im doing. So I said to these guys, you going to see, just like central casting, I said, I said, Fellas, how good is this plane They said, Sir, its great. Why Because the enemy cant see it. That helps. Stealth. Its actually called super stealth. So I said, You mean they cant see, so you shoot at them but they cant He said, They have no idea where we are, sir. I said, That sounds good to me. Nobody does it. Nobody can do it. We have the whole thing and we bought in a lot of those planes, we bought in a lot of great stuff. And I wont tell you the story, but very early on I thought we were going to have a problem someplace, and one of the generals came up to me and said, Sir, dont go. Dont do it. Why We dont have the ammunition. And I said two things. I never want to hear a President. Right We never want to have a President hear that again, nor do we want a President to have to go through the crap that we were going through back then. But, another thing we did, which to me is such an incredible thing to have done. Its such an honor. So our last US Armed Forces, the last branch was the Air Force, right That was many, many decades ago. We are now building and we have now gotten funding for the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, The Space Force. So Ill be able to tell my kids someday and everybody else, See that Space Force That was my baby. And you think that was easy Thats not easy. Because you have Democrats that do not like our military. They do not like our military. And we did something yesterday, because for three years I would see people that run Incredible people, the heads of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country. And every year theyd come in and theyd be looking for help. They needed help and they do need help with it and its great and they do an incredible job. So many great schools, but they need help. And every year theyd have to come and come. I got to know them actually. I said, The only bad thing is you wont see me too much anymore. Because we just provided record funding for a nations Historically Black Colleges and Universities. And its longterm, theyre not going to have to come. So I said, Look, we could do it where we do it every year or well do what we have. What do you want They said, Let us just have it. So well miss them. But they are great people. Theyve done an incredible job. And our extraordinary jobs boom, which created another 266,000 jobs last month, and then you add the undercount from the previous two months, youre close to 300,000 jobs. And they said, if youre a business watcher which I am, I love watching business, but they said they were guessing, could be 70,000, could be 80,000, maybe 90, maybe 110, somebody said. Then the number comes out, 266,000 with an adjustment. Remember about four months ago when we had one little period, right We had one little period where there was a little downturn. They said, Oh, Oh, we think were going into a recession. I said, Dont worry about it. We think were going into a recession. They were willing to lose their wealth. They were willing for this stocks and whatever the hell they own, what do you guys own back there Let it go. Theyll go bust. They dont care. Anything to get rid of us. Not me, us. And you know what Then all of a sudden, and now for the last couple of weeks, weve set brand new records in the history of the various stock markets. So, as of yesterday, weve had 133 record days in the stock market now, and thats in less than three years. So when I see that I dont care because I dont Im not allowed to have stock. I cant have stock. They consider it a conflict of interest and that I can understand. I agree. I can. But you know what Ill tell you what. What I see, I see tremendous job growth because were setting records. But you know what I also see The 401ks where people are up 90%, theyre up 97%, theyre up 82%. I tell you the story all the time. I mean, I have people coming up to me, and a man came up, a policeman. Ive told this story, but Ive had many, so many times, but this guy in particular, because it was early and that was a year ago. That was a long time ago. Right now its much higher than that. But he said, Sir, I want to thank you. My wife thinks Im a loser. All my life, we never did well with the 401ks, with stocks. Everything I invested, Im up 72%, sir. She thinks Im a financial genius. Shes so in love with me. She so in love. He said, She said, Darling, I think youre one of the greatest investors. Why dont you do this professionally And I dont even know what Im doing, sir. I just have all these stocks. So I just wanted to tell you, I look at a 401k, who has 401ks here So thats what I see. I dont care about the rich ones. I care about everybody. I care. I care about everybody actually. Ford motor company just announced that it is investing 1.5 billion dollars into auto factories in the Detroit area, creating another 3000 Michigan jobs. And thats on top of the many other investments weve gotten from Japanese companies, car companies, and other companies. But theyre all coming in and a lot of them are coming to Michigan. And I say, Hey, go to Michigan. Sometimes theyll go south and thats okay, whatever. I want them in this country. But ideally I want to fill them up. Were doing so well in Michigan with the auto companies. Now youre back. Youre back. So, youre back. Very proud of you. Very proud of you. But while were creating jobs, fighting for Michigan workers, and achieving numbers that youve never seen before, incredible victories for the American people are happening. The radical left in Congress is consumed with hatred and envy and rage. You see whats going on Ill tell you, these people are crazy. You ever hear, Its the economy, stupid. You know that was Clintons saying. If you have a good economy. I have the greatest economy in the history of this country and nobody talks about it. Nobody talks about it. If youre a Democrat, they say,  Oh, its the economy If the economys any good. And let me just tell you a little secret. If crooked Hillary wouldve won, your economy would have crashed. You were going down. The regulations were taking it down. The taxes were taking it down, instead of being up 92% or whatever youre up, a lot, you would have been down, you would have been at less than half. It was crashing. For all those people that would say, Oh, its the Obama Let me tell you something. You were dying. And if you look at that first period of a couple of months, it was a disaster, but it was heading south. And as sure as youre standing, and Im sorry we couldnt get you seats, we didnt have any room. And by the way, 20,000 people outside had to leave. You know Its so cold outside we told them, Dont worry about a screen, go home, go home and watch. But we had, this is about a 5,500 seat arena. And I said to my people, Why so small Are we spoiled I watch these guys come in like Biden, he has a big rally and they get 93 people show up. No, its true. I dont understand it. And did you see the new polls from USA Today came out Im killing everybody. And they hate me. USA Today hates me. But theres a poll, were beating everybody. But, so Biden has this rally, theyve got 200 seats, but only a small number of people. So you know what they do They set up a round table. So think of these people. They come in, they think theyre going to listen to the speech, they end up sitting on a round table discussing They mustve been happy, right We dont have enough room for round tables. Im sorry folks. No, they set up a round table but I think were doing great. And how do you beat what weve done With the economy, with our great vets, with choice. Youve finally got choice. Theyve been trying to get it for almost 50 years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. And these people back here Your seat or stand is better. Right But you know what Theyre going to be much more famous because the cameras cant see you. They can only see them. And the other thing, the cameras, do you ever notice, I go to these stadiums, 25, 30,000 people. They never show the crowd. You know why Because they dont want to have If crazy Pocahontas, if crazy Pocahontas goes to the middle of Central Park or whatever. Shes in Manhattan. You got me. And people, I mean, I could have, I could have Baron Trump go into Central Park and hed get a crowd that would be just as Hes 13. Hed get a bigger crowd. But if she has the crowd, Oh, these crowds are so big. Ive had crowds over the last couple of weeks. We went to different Pennsylvania, Florida. But I mean thousands and thousands of people cant get into these NBA arenas, right Big arenas. And we set records at everyone because we use the floor. Thank you. I appreciate it. But we use the floor, right The basketball court. So we set records at every arena. They never even mention the crowds. They never mention the crowds. Its sort of amazing. You know what I dont think weve ever had an empty seat from the time I came down the escalator. Thats a long time ago. I dont think weve ever had an empty seat. Now what the crooked media does though, if you got like over here, look how packed it is and theres thousands outside, but I Please go home. Youre going to catch pneumonia. But heres the thing. If this man and that beautiful woman happened to get up because they want to go to the bathroom, those cameras will turn to those two seats and theyll say Trump wasnt able to fill up the arena. I always get nervous when I see some I know theyre coming back. Nobody ever leaves our speeches. Because is there a better place to be in the world than a Trump rally But every time I see a man get up, I see a beautiful woman with a baby and theyre getting up. The babys going crazy and theyre getting up. Theyre going to take it But I know theyre going to be right back. And I say, Fill those two seats. I dont want them to see it. Because theyll say, Couldnt fill up the arena. These are truly dishonest people. After three years of sinister witch hunts, hoaxes, scams, tonight the House Democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic Americans. Capped off with one of the greatest election evenings in history. Was that the greatest Remember when they all said, remember when they all said, No, no. You cant win Michigan. You cant. Then I went, I did one in Grand Rapids, right Grand Rapids. We had 32,000 people that night. It was one oclock in the morning. That means it was Election Day when I started speaking. Hillary, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Bill Clinton, they did an emergency trip. They did an emergency trip to Michigan at six oclock. They got here at prime time. They started to speak. She had 500 people. I got here at one oclock in the morning the next day, which is now Election Day. How many people were there 32,000 people outside, inside. It was the last speech of Michigan. And they say, Well, sir, its very hard to win Michigan. I said, Why would it be hard Heres the beautiful thing. Everything I told you Ive done, but much more so. I said I was going to bring car companies back. I said I was going to bring in I just hope you people know that. I just hope you know it. But Ill never forget that night. And in all fairness to Bill Clinton, he used to be a friend of mine until I ran for office. I like him, I like him. But he told, you know the way they tried to shut him out, right Because hes a pro. Hes an instinct guy, right Hes instinct. He doesnt need Right Because hes a pro. Hes an instinct guy, right Hes instinct. He doesnt need polling companies. Who the hell wants him You know, if you want a polling company, pick up the newspaper. The problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write. They write fake polls. Its true, they write fake polls. You call them suppression polls. You read them and you get depressed, because it looks like youre doing badly. They do that. I think its almost worse than what they write, and you cant get much worse than what they write. So what happens is Bill Clinton said to Crooked Hillary, his very dishonest wife, Crooked Hillary. Do you think he calls her Crooked Hillary He might. Maybe he just calls her crooked He said, Crooked, Im telling you. Crooked, I dont like what Im seeing in Michigan. I dont like what Im seeing in Wisconsin. He said, I took the trip to Wisconsin and Ill tell you what, they had those Trump/Pence signs all the way to the convention area, every lawn, every loan. I dont like Wisconsin. And then he said, Oh, dont worry about it. What the hell does he know They told him, What do you know Remember, they shut him out at the  They didnt want him talking. He was right. I mean, I dont want to cause any problems in the family, but he was right. But he talked about Wisconsin. Then he talked about Michigan. He said, Crooked, Im telling you, Crooked, I dont like what Im seeing in Michigan. I was in Michigan and Im telling you, they had those damn signs. I saw some houses where they had four of them on one lawn, and two of them on the car. And he said, You horrible human being. Youd better start listening to me, because youre going to get your ass whooped And you know what happened You know what happened She didnt listen, fortunately. And she didnt come to Michigan enough. And she didnt come to Wisconsin, I think at all, right Because her polling data looked good. It looked good to me, too. Every time I went there with these crowds. So we won Wisconsin. We won Michigan and the great Ronna McDaniel  where is Ronna Where is Ronna Ronna, she was so horrible. I didnt know her, Ronna McDaniel, and she was so aggressive. She kept calling and said, Could you please come out to Michigan I said, Who the hell are you And I said, What do you mean, another trip So anyway, I made, we had these big crowds. I made it again. Then finally I said, two weeks out, I said, Ronna, no more. Were going to win it or were not. Okay. 00 in the evening for this final deal in Grand Rapids. Sir, could you come to Michigan tonight And I thought, I was just about finished. I went to a last great state, and I said, Its over. Now I sit back and I watch, and lets see what happens, right But she said, Could you come to Michigan I said, that is the most aggressive human being Ive ever met. And we did it. And we won Michigan. And the word is that were much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in 2016 in Michigan. You better remember when you walk into  you know, its November 3rd this time, November 3rd. By the way though, that evening, that incredible evening in November, one of the biggest nights in the history of television. You never hear them say it, so I might as well. That election  and my debates  you see their debates are dying. Who wants to watch Buttigieg, Buttigieg Buttigieg You know that you pronounce it they say  I heard some guy saying, No, no, because its an unpronounceable name. Thats why they call him Mayor Pete, right Mayor Pete. Mayor Pete. Mayor Pete Ive had you up to here, Mayor Pete. No, Buttigieg is leading. How does  no, you say it this way. You say it  they call him Mayor Pete, because nobody can pronounce his last name. Thats the only  people think it says  by the way, you know what Im not going to say bad things about him. You know why Id love him to win. I thought I knocked off Pocahontas. I did it a year too early, a year too early. I give her credit, she then started to come back. I dont think shes going to make it though. Shes gasping. Shes gasping for air. But I saw them pronouncing Buttigieg, and they said, Heres what you do, boot edge edge. Say, Edge, like the edge of a building. Edge edge, Buttigieg. Alfred E. Newman. You got to be older to know what that means. But congressional Democrats are directly attacking 2.3 million Michigan voters who rose up in 2016, won the state, and now the Democrats are very upset. They want to get Michigan back. They just dont know how to do it, because they didnt do a thing for Michigan. They didnt do anything for Michigan. All they did was take away your companies and let them go to Mexico and other places. You know, I dont know if you know it, Mexico has 32% of your car business. You know that, right Not because of me. Theyre not moving. But Mexico has  32% of our car business moved to Mexico. Can you believe this Before I got there, but thats what I used to talk about. I said, when I was honored that night, I said, How do you let this happen How do you let all these companies leave It used to go,  its probably maybe the single biggest reason I ran for president. It might be the  and I had a lot of them. Immigration, I had a lot of them, but that may be the single biggest. With todays illegal unconstitutional and partisan impeachment, the do nothing Democrats, and they are do nothing  all they want to do is focus on this, what they could be doing  are declaring their deep hatred and disdain for the American voter. This lawless, partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the Democrat Party. Have you seen my polls in the last four weeks Its crazy. Its crazy. You know why Because people, we have an election right down the road. I announced three months ago that Im running, right Ill give you a little clue. I announced because I figured once I announce, theyd never impeach, nobody would be so stupid. But theyd been trying to impeach me from day one. Theyve been trying to impeach me from before I ran, okay Because if you remember when I ran, I went immediately to number one, never came off number one. We had center stage from day one in the debates. So we had, I dont know, 14, 15 debates. We had a total of 18, actually. People forgot there was one that they never talk about it, but thats okay. But we had 18 people, and I was center stage. And I said, Wait a minute, this is no good. I want odd numbers, because of your center stage, if you have a 10 that means two people are in the middle. So I said, Make it 11 or make it nine, or Im not showing up. And generally they did it, because we were way ahead from the beginning. But I made a lot of great friends out of that group, and many of them are good friends today. Although you wouldnt know it based on the  they say that was the meanest  that was a pretty mean primary, you got to say. Wasnt that fun I liked it. Through their depraved actions today, Crazy Nancy Pelosis House Democrats have branded themselves with an eternal mark of shame, and it really is. Its a disgrace. Democrat lawmakers do not believe you have the right to select your own president. They think that the Washington swamp, which we believe it or not, it aint easy, because they got so much stacked, including these guys. You know what These guys are apart of the Democrat Party. They are a part of it. You might as well call them Democrats. You know, its owned by Commicast. Theyre just as bad as CNN, or theyre just as bad as MSNBC. And by the way, CNN and MSNBC, their ratings are down the tubes. Its great. I love it. I love it. But they think the Washington swamp should be able to veto the results of an election. Thats what they think. Theres never been a time like this. Think of it, you have the greatest economy in the history of the world. Other countries come to see me, all of their leaders, and they say, Sir,  first thing, Sir, congratulations on your economy. Were trying to do the same thing. Congratulations, sir. And these guys dont like talking about it. And if they do, they say, Obama did it. Oh, Obama, Obama. Remember Obama said, You will never be president. He will never be president Then remember he said, I will consider it a personal front if you allow him to be president And then I became president. He wasnt so happy. And in all fairness, he campaigned harder than Crooked Hillary, because he had more strength. I mean, I go to these places, Secret Service, they take me. I havent seen a lobby in three years. Its true. I go through basements. I pass compactor plants. I know more about compactors from this job. I dont see lobbies. I say Fellows, you think you could ever maybe take me through a lobby No, sir. But Ill tell you what. I go upstairs, downstairs, all around. Theyre taking me up three flights, go down one. I said, Are we almost there Yes, sir, another four flights. And I say, You think Hillary could do this I dont think so. Theyd bring her back home. She wants to go to sleep. And now I hear she wants to run again. Wouldnt that be great Oh. Thank you. Thank you. Oh would we love that You think the Democrats are screwed up Wait until that happens. Wouldnt that be  Oh, theres my guy. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Well look, based on the FBI report, you just saw what happened with the IG, where they came out with the FBI. Based on that, you know what I never stopped you. But now, think of what they did. Think of what they did. Think of how dishonest it all was. They shouldnt even be allowed to have an impeachment, because it was based on dishonesty. It was based on illegality. She went out, and they paid for a fake dossier. They gave money to foreigners to write a fake dossier, totally disproven, totally fake. The FBI then took that fake dossier and they used it in the FISA Court to get approval to spy on my campaign. And if we were Democrats, they wouldve been in jail two years ago. Its a disgrace. Think of what they did. So they use this fake dossier, and they brought it before this big deal court. Its a big deal, the FISA Court. And they said this stuff, and they lied about it, because Comey, whos another beauty  did I do a great job when I fired his ass What a great job. Oh no, they had bad plans. No, I did a great thing. That was like throwing a rock at a hornets nest. Did that place explode And then we learned about Lisa Page, and her wonderful lover, Peter Strzok. I love you Lisa. I love you more than anybody in the world. I love you more than anybody in the world. It causes problems with the wife, but we wont talk about that. Those tapes didnt work well. No, how about those statements, right And then they say, In all fairness,  I really liked the report, but how does the Inspector General say  because dont forget, he was appointed by Obama. So Im not knocking him because he gave us a lot of nuggets, but we had a lot of those nuggets. How does the Inspector General say, You have these horrible  hes going to lose. Isnt he Hes going to lose, or shes going to win 100 million. Did you see all the zeros It was like  Im blinking. I says, I think its 100. Hes going to lose 100 to one. Isnt he Peter I love you so much, Peter. Ive never loved anyone like you. Hes going to lose 100 million to one, Peter, right Thats right. Hes going to lose 100 million to one. But theres no bias. How about the insurance policy To me, the greatest. Just in case she loses, we have an insurance policy Were in the insurance policy right now folks Weve been in it for three years, thats what they meant. I mean the insurance policy is on an artificial respirator, because were doing awfully well. And Ill tell you something, Rush Limbaugh said it. Sean Hannity said it. Laura Ingram said it. Tucker said it. Ainsley said it, but a lot of people have said it. They said, Theres nobody in the world that could have handled that stuff that happened, and still created one of the greatest economies, and done more than any other president ever before in the first three years. I understand that. I understand that, but its my life, very unfair to my family. I have to say this very, very unfair to my family. What they put my family through is a disgrace. Me, its my life. Its fine. I do. But you know what What they put my family through is a disgrace, and they ought to be ashamed, and we should get apologies all over the place. So yesterday I sent Pelosi a letter denouncing and condemning her partys outrageous abusive power. Thats what it is. They have nothing. Theyre the ones that should be impeached, every one of them. I mean you got this guy, Schiff. He makes up a statement, and he goes in front of Congress where he has immunity, and he makes up a statement from me thats totally fictitious, totally out of thin air. The worst statement Ive ever heard. Many people saw it. I had a person two weeks ago that said, I didnt love the statement you made. I said, Really Didnt you read the transcripts I always say, Read the transcript. But didnt you read it No, no. I heard it on television. I watched Adam Schiff. He made it up. I then sent him the transcript. He said, Oh, now I feel better. Thats perfect. I call it perfect. He called it perfect. Everyone calls it, if you read it. But heres the thing. He makes up this statement, and it finished. Didnt he have eight quid pro quos Eight. Could you imagine, youre dealing with a country, and you say eight times that youve got to do something. The first time they say, Well. The second time they say, Thats strange. Third time they say, Whats wrong You said eight times Eight times. Theyd have you arrested. Theyd have you put into an insane asylum. But he actually said  I think he said eight, not seven, eight. And then he finished with, Dont call me, Ill call you. Can you imagine The President of the United States, Dont call me, Ill call you. You know what that is Thats a mafia statement, okay Thats the head of the mafia saying, Dont call me. This guy actually said that, and then he walked away and people became incensed, because they knew that wasnt the people that read the thing. Most people believed him. Hes a liar Because you know, hes a corrupt politician, 100%. No, hes a corrupt  and then I see him. By the way, you ever see this guy He walks up to the mics. I mean, were not  all fairness, look, I dont want to be  because with Me Too, I never even think about looks anymore, okay I dont talk about looks of a male or a female, but in his case, lets just say  the last time Ill ever refer to this. Hes not exactly the best looking guy weve ever seen. No, any mic. He walks up to the mic, and hes so just, This is a sad, sad day for America. Our president is an employee of Russia. I have absolute proof that the president, this is at the beginning, and every week theyd say, Wheres the proof Its coming. Its coming. Then we get the Mueller report, nothing. And Ill tell you what, I know some of the people in this audience. If I spent not 45 million, not 18 Trump haters, I call them the angry Democrats. It was 13, then it went to 18, and then Mueller. Did Muller do a good job Did he do a good job No Boo How was his performance in front of Congress Boo Not the best, but think of this, 45 million they spent. And you know, I heard somebody say, Well, we got back some of that money. Let me tell you, you cost this country billions, and billions, and billions of dollars in all of the things that didnt get done, in all of the embarrassment to our country. You caused billions and billions of dollars, and it was a hoax. But this guy, Schiff, I have absolute proof. I have this. I have that, this, that. Anytime he sees a camera and hes stone faced, stone faced. Hes a pathological liar. He gets up, and Ive never seen anything like it. Even I was saying, I wonder what he has. What does he have He says, I have absolute, I said, I havent spoken to Russia in year. What the hell do I have to do with Russia But this guy gets up  oh, I think we have a vote coming in. Haleigh Wow Thank you, Haleigh, great job. Wow. The Republican party has never been so affronted, but theyve never been so united as they are right now, ever, never. And I know the senators, and theyre great guys, and women too. We have some great women. We have great guys. Theyre great people. They love this country. Theyre going to do the right thing. Theyre going to do the right thing. So I said in my letter to Pelosi  I love that. You know, usually theres one, two. The Republicans, look, Ive said it for a long time. The Democrats are lousy politicians, they really are. Theyve got horrible policies, open borders, crime is fine, drugs pouring through. I mean, think of what they do. Sanctuary cities, they love sanctuary cities. Theyre lousy politicians, but they have one thing  two things. They are vicious. Theyre the most vicious people. The Republicans arent as vicious. They may learn to be vicious after going through this, though. But the other thing, the Democrats always stick together. Now think of it, three Democrats went over to our side, no Republicans. Its unheard of. And by the way, this is for a hundred years. Im not just talking about this little point in time. The Republicans are known as, its always harder to stick together. These people are great. We have a great Republican Party, and we have to get that change. We have to take back the house. Youll have the greatest healthcare ever if we take  and by the way, we had another victory. The individual mandate, just a little while ago, it came over the wires, it was just upheld. The individual mandate is now gone. The most unpopular part of Obamacare. It was just upheld. So I said in my letter to Pelosi, By proceeding with your invalid impeachment, youre violating your oath of office. Youre breaking your allegiance to the Constitution. Youre declaring open war on American democracy. You dare to invoke the founding fathers in pursuit of this election nullification scheme, yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for Americas founding, and your egregious conduct. And listen though, its so true, it threatens to destroy what our founders pledged, and in fact their very lives to build. You are the ones interfering in Americas elections. You are the one subverting Americas democracy. We did nothing wrong, nothing whatsoever. This was just an excuse. You are the ones that are obstructing justice. You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our republic for your own selfish, personal, political and partisan gain. Theyre bringing pain. The work we could be doing on lowering drug prices, on getting rid of these horrible, horrible situations. You know in the border  the woman is okay Is she okay Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. I mean, some of these people are waiting here for three days, right Thank you. Theyll come back. Come back. Merry Christmas Thank you. Merry Christmas is true. But what theyve done with this perversion, its perversion. And when you watch some of these people get up and speak today, they dont even  You have violated the Constitution. Well, what does he done wrong Well, we dont know that. They dont even have any crime. This is the first impeachment where theres no crime. I say, Tell me what I did, please. Well, we dont know. You violated the Constitution. You had Turley, whos smart, Alan Dershowitz, these guys. All of them, they said, Theres no crime. Theres no crime, right Theres no crime Theres no crime Im the first person that ever get impeached, and theres no crime. I feel guilty. You know what they call it Impeachment light. Its impeachment light. Thats why, with Richard Nixon, I just see it as a very dark era, very dark, very  oh, you dont even like to think. I dont know about you, but Im having a good time, its crazy. But I also know we have a great group of people behind us in the Republican Party, we really do. Maybe I wouldnt feel the same way, but we have a great group of people behind us. We had in the House, and we have it in the Senate. Theyre doing a great job, so Im not worried. Im not worried, because its always good when you dont do anything wrong, you get impeached. That may be a record that will last forever. But you know what they have done Theyve cheapened the impeachment process. And now anybody that become  this is a sacred position. Anybody that becomes president, I mean, they could have a phone call and they get impeached. So if the Republicans  if you had a Democrat as president, we have a Republican house, they dont like the guy for whatever reason, or the woman, they impeach the person. Its cheapened it. Its exactly what our founding fathers didnt want, and they said it could happen, and its happened. But I know one thing, Americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote Pelosi the hell out of office. But its so disappointing. I see a woman, Carolyn Maloney. Shes a long time, nothing much, believe me. Shes a Congresswoman from Manhattan, the east side. I was with her. Her first race, I helped her. She was always so nice, Oh, thank you, thank you. I made lots of contributions over the years. In New York, if youre not a  its purely Democrat, especially in Manhattan. So what happens I make lots of contributions for years, and years, and years. I go run. The first person I see, Carolyn Maloney. I raise my hand to impeach. Well, give me back the damn money that Ive been paying her for so many years. Let her pay me back all the money. Let her pay me back all the money. Then you have this Dingell. Dingell, you know Dingell, from Michigan. You know Dingell You ever hear of her, Michigan Debbie Dingell, thats a real beauty. So she calls me up like eight months ago. Her husband was here a long time, but I didnt give him the B treatment. I didnt give him the C or the D. I couldve. Nobody what is, you know I gave the A treatment. Take down the flags. While youre taking them down for ex-Congressman Dingell  Oh, okay   do this, do that, do that, rotunda everything. I gave him everything. Thats okay. I dont want anything for it. I dont need anything for anything. She calls me up. Its the nicest thing thats ever happened. Thank you so much. John would be so thrilled. Hes looking down. Hed be so thrilled. Thank you so much, sir. I said, Thats okay, dont worry about it. Maybe hes looking up I dont know. I dont know. Maybe, maybe. But lets assume hes looking down. But I gave him A, not A, not B, not B. I gave him the A, and she called me. She said, Oh, no. I wont go into the conversation, because its not fair do that. But all I want to say is, lets put it this way, it was the most profuse thank you that you could ever get on a scale of zero to 10, it was a 10. Okay, so that was what February or something. Now they talk about this phony impeachment, and shes out there, Well, we have to look seriously at our president, because he may have violated the Constitution of the United States. Boo And I cant be happy with that, because I love our country. I love this, and I love that. She loves everything. I said, Shes a no, okay No, but I look at her, and shes so sincere, and what happens I vote to impeach Trump. And you know what I didnt say, Who the hell knew this was even going to come up I went through the whole Muller hoax. They did this big report. I was totally exonerated. They didnt even bring it up at the impeachment, because I was totally exonerated. If they saw one little kernel, one little quarter of a sentence  look what they did with one word. Remember this, what did I do Why did I do Its us. But they dont say it that way. They say, I. They read it totally different, schiff and his band of thieves, they read it. Now I say basically, very simple, do us a favor, our country. Do us Do us Not me Our country And then what do I say I say, The United States Attorney General, Attorney General of the United States could speak to you, it would be great, okay Because its known for major corruption. In fact, the new leader of Ukraine got in on a construction  on a platform where he looks for all of the problems of dishonesty, and everything that was going on in Ukraine, right He looked for it, thats how he got into office. He got into office that way. So we take it and they repeat it a thousand times, and they never say with the right  so I go wild, and we start. And the Republicans have got it right. Now we always correct him, but I use the word us. Us is the United States, our country. And then it actually says, I think, Comma, country, but they dont say that. They say, Do me a favor. How many times have you heard it Where they say in a speech And then the president said, do me a favor. Well, thats not what I said. I said, Do us a favor, our country. And then I said, the Attorney General of the United States, I didnt say my campaign- I said the Attorney General of the United States, I didnt say my campaign manager. Okay I said the attorney  And these people want to impeach the President of the United States for that Oh, and then what happened Right Then what happened So then, the President of Ukraine, whos a quality person, said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever. That was a killer for the Democrats, right Then his foreign minister said the same thing. He said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever. There was no pressure. Thats a killer. So now did you see what the Democrats did a couple of days ago They tried to say that hes not a strong person, that he was weak. They used the word weak, that he was weak, and under the power of Trump, he said. Do you know how insulting that is Anybody that becomes president of a country, and thats a big country and its a tough country, you got to be tough. Hes tough. But so what theyre saying now is he was weak because the wording, it just doesnt fit. Okay These are really dishonest people. And if the press was fair, this thing never would have happened. So the House Democrats are surrendering their majority, their dignity, their reputations. They look like a bunch of fools. And Ill tell you, we have a lot of new stars in the Republican Party, I could read off a list of 20 names. But theyre giving up their honor, and theyll receive a big backlash at the box office. When you take a look, that ballot box, that ballot box on November 3rd, I think were going to have crowds like weve never had. And Ill tell you something, it used to be, theyd always say, Oh, the Republicans. You know, in 2018, I didnt run. I didnt run, right They all said, Oh, we didnt. Well actually, we picked up two seats in the Senate that these guys never talk about. We just approved 171 federal court justices, 171 federal justices, including courts of appeal, 171. Well be up, probably by the end of the year, to 182, and for that, I thank President Obama. He gave me 142 openings. He gave me 142. I said to him, my people, I got there, because they say the most important thing you could do as a president is judges and Supreme Court. We have two great Supreme Court judges. Right Two Justices of the Supreme court, Kavanaugh, Gorsuch. Two great men. Theyre great. And how about the pain that they put Justice Kavanaugh through, right Over a phony deal, I hate to tell you. Over a phony deal. What a disgrace, what they put that man through and that family through. Just remember it come November. You got to remember, its a long time. You know, in the life of Trump, 10 months is an eternity. Its a long time. Somebody said, Congratulations sir, youre going to win. I said, Dont say that. Just dont talk about it. Lets always pretend youre one point down. Like last time. Going to be close. Nope, its going to be close. But what they put that man through was horrible, what they put his family through was horrible. And you know, those stories largely have been recanted. And frankly, the ones that didnt recant, I dont know what a Supreme Court judge does, but he should sue them. He should sue them. So we want to take back the House, well hold the Senate, and well keep the White House. You will have the greatest healthcare. You will continue with the greatest judges. You know, we have judges that are  We just had a great story in the Wall Street Journal. I have to be always very truthful, because if Im a little bit off, they call me a liar. Theyll say, He gets a Pinocchio, the stupid Washington Post, they have Pinocchio. I mean, even if youre saying things perfectly, its a Pinocchio. Theres nothing you can say where you dont get a Pinocchio. But what happens, what happens is we have Wall Street Journal the other day got the best story. They said, Whether you like him or not, the job hes done on judges and Supreme Court Justices, but the job hes done on judges is amazing. Say its the most important thing. See, I dont agree. I say defense is the most, the military is the most. But once youre beyond the military, I mean to me defense is the most important. Because without good defense, maybe we dont need judges so much, right Its like somebody said, Well, we violated the budget. I said, Do me a favor, dont worry about the budget. If were attacked and arent doing very well and somebody says, Well, at least we have a good budget, that doesnt work too well. Right That doesnt work. So we have great military, we have great judges, we have great everything. Drug prices down. For the first time in 51 years, drug prices came down. And that was with no help from the Democrats. If they helped, because you need their votes, if they helped, I could get those drug prices down 40 and 50%. Okay And we just approved, and were approving very soon for the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, where he can buy, he has the right to go, were giving him the right to go and buy from a foreign country, where the prices for the identical drug, identical drug are 50% less. Hes going to do that for the people of Florida. And were going to do that for your governors if they want to do that. Well get that down so far. Everyone in America can see straight through the Washington Democrats phony, dangerous charade. Schiff makes up so many things. Pelosi makes it up, and she backs him up. I saw her on a television show, and George Stephanopoulos, thats another beauty, he said, even he said, he was defending me. I couldnt believe it. He made this statement, But you know he lied on that. He made up this stuff. No, he didnt, he didnt. So that means Nancy Pelosi said no, the statement that he made up. But its all going to end soon, and its going to come out to a beautiful, great victory for the Republican Party and for this nation. Thank you very much. So thats it. We have the greatest country. Weve turned around a ship. We need four more years. If we dont have it  Now, if you want to drive them crazy, we had one group in Pennsylvania, some guy started screaming,  16 more years. 16. They went crazy. And you know what they dont understand When I do get out, theyre all going to go out of business. Theyre making more money than theyve ever made. That crazy New York Times, one of the worst newspapers in the world, one of the most dishonest newspapers in the history of the world, totally phony. They came out with a story, where it was a great headline for me, and the people that read it, the super radical left, they called and complained so much that they changed the headline and took it from positive to negative on a good story. Can you believe it No, theyre among the most dishonest people. But Ill never forget, before I took that great escalator ride down with our First Lady  Our First Lady is doing a great job, great job. I said, First Lady, youre so lucky I took you on this journey, this wonderful, beautiful journey. And it is. You know why its a wonderful, beautiful journey Because look at, what were accomplishing is unbelievable. Its unprecedented. It is unprecedented what were accomplishing. Youre so lucky, I said it to all my people. I have great people in the back. I say, You folks are so lucky I took you on this. You could be home right now, relaxing. But Id rather be here, frankly, than any place. These rallies are great. Theyre inspiring. You are inspiring. And you know, its funny, were not even into election season. Yeah, its a long way away. Were not even in it. And yet, I think the enthusiasm right now is greater than it was even before the 2016 election. Does that make any sense I think a lot of it has to do with a witch hunt. A lot of it has to do with the phony, witch hunt because youre smart people. Youre the elite. Theyre not the elite. Youre the elite. Youre the elite. You do better than they do. They talk about it, dont you hate it Well, the elite   Oh really I went to better schools. Many of you went to better schools. We wont talk about homes, even though your homes are nicer. We wont talk about jobs. You see the jobs reports You see whats happening Do you see where wages are going up You know, when I first started, when I was here, one of my first speeches, I was talking that people made more money, that was four years ago, so it was 20 years before that, so thats 24, 25 years ago. They made more money 24 years ago than they were making when I got elected president. And they worked one job versus two or three jobs. Now its going up beautifully and we want that, the salaries. And you know, the number one group of people that are going up is the blue collar worker. Its percentage, the best. The blue collar worker. They had two and three jobs. The blue collar worker is going up the most. Anyway, so you know what else The thing Im happiest about, African American unemployment, the lowest in the history of our country. African American. Remember I used to say, you remember, look at, you. Are you the greatest guy Everyone thinks, do I pay Im telling you, I have a group of African American guys, and gals by the way, that follow me around and they think I pay them, and I dont. I love them, they love me. They come. How many rallies have you come to A lot. Theyre great people, just great. Thank you. I dont even know who the hell he is. Is that right I dont know him, but I like him. I see him at so many rallies. I appreciate it. You and your group, theyre great people. Thank you. So youre obviously doing well if you can travel around like that, right Ah, he knows. I appreciate it, I really do. I think its fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. But think of this, African-American unemployment is the lowest its ever been in the history of our country. Their poverty levels, they had a horrible poverty level, in the negative sense, now their poverty levels are the best theyve ever been in the history of our country. Same with Hispanic Americans, the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers. And the same with Asians, the best unemployment. And women, Im sorry, 71 years, best in 71 years. Ive let the women down But I think within another couple of months, youll be historical. So only 71 years best. The best in 71 years. But what were doing has been an incredible thing. Its an incredible thing. When Im on the debate stage with one of these characters, and they try and say negative stuff, Ill just say, Well, heres the story. In the history of our country, this group is doing the best, and that group is doing the best, and the women are doing the best, and everybodys doing. And frankly, you know what it is The whole countrys doing the best. Okay The whole country is doing the best. So we have records and everything, and yet theyre trying to, and they really are, Ive never seen anything like it, theyre accusing me, really, of doing what Joe Biden  Biden admitted what he did. How about this They protect him. Did you see the crummy debate Those debates are so boring. Theyre dying in the ratings. Theyre dying, theyre dying.  While its totally unsupported Whats unsupported Hes on tape saying that hes holding back 1 billion from Ukraine unless you change the prosecutor. How about that question I wont say who answered, because you know Im not, I actually used to like the guy, he was a nice guy to me, but now I dont like him so much, but thats okay. But he goes, While its totally unsubstantiated, and while we beg your mercy that were asking you even to bring up this question, but President Trump said you refused to give 1 billion of taxpayer money to Ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your sons company. And Sleepy Joe gives a sleepy answer, and thats the end of it. Thats it. Then whenever I bring it up, do you ever notice they always use,  While these charges are totally unsubstantiated Hes on tape If that were me, its the electric chair. They would bring the electric chair back. No, the guys on tape, and they always say its unsubstantiated. It is not supported by fact, one of them the other day, they finally changed the word. It is supported by fact. No, its supported by tape. No, its unbelievable. In many ways, Id like to have him win because number one, hes going to have to eventually answer that question, and number  She said he doesnt know where he is. Thats the other problem. Now, Ive been doing this for a long time, and I have much bigger crowds than anybodys ever had in history. By the way, do you know what I say it against the fake news, because you know what theyre going to say. Every stadium is packed. I give my people one instruction, get the largest stadium you can get. Now, thats why I was a little surprised. But in Battle Creek, you dont have that many, right Not too many stadiums. But I wanted to be here. You know why I wanted to be here First of all the crowd is incredible. The crowd outside. But let me tell you. No, you know why I wanted to be here Because we have a lot of choices, but I wanted to be here because this area supported me so overwhelmingly, and I said, I want to be there. Pretty simple, pretty simple. Pretty simple. I wanted to be here for that reason, and I just want to say thank you, because Ill tell you what, you came in  I dont know, I didnt get 100%, but we got a damn good percentage, right We got a damn good percentage. So its really thrilling to be here. But were joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders. Your Michigan House Speaker, Lee Chatfield. Wheres Lee Lee, come up if you want. Come on, what the hell, we have nothing else to do. Should we get him up Yes. Come up Lee, come up Lee, get up here. Come on up, Lee. Republican Party Chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, who I spoke to. And the bottom line on the end of her story, so when I won I said, Whos going to head up the RNC I said, I got to get that woman from Michigan. Remember they were all saying, You cant win Michigan Now were going to win it by so much, you better remember all those. Every time a car plant opens, please think about Trump. Come on up here, Lee. Michigan GOP Chairwoman, Laura Cox. Thank you. Hate to tell you, but all your congressmen, you know where they are right now. Your congressmen, all of your Congresspeople, men, wonderful people, theyre at a place called Congress right now. Theyre doing an unbelievable job of supporting your President and supporting you. They had a choice, Sir, should we leave and be there I said, Dont leave. Stay right where you are. Thats why we got that vote. Thats some vote, right Lee The Chairman of the Womans Workers and Workers for Trump, and a proud union autoworker, Terry Bowman, whos been so terrific. Thank you, Terry. Come on up. And while Democrats are obsessed with impeachment, were focused on jobs, jobs, jobs. This group, local leaders. And all your Washington folks, they are right where they have to be in Washington tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Great job. Thank you very much. Weve eliminated more job-killing regulations than any administration in the history of our country, whether its four years or eight years, or in one case, much more than eight years. In a period of two and a half years, we have eliminated more regulations than any other president, by far. Youre saving almost 3,000 a year because of regulation cuts. Total income gains for median households will reach 10,000 a family. Ill give you a couple of quick numbers. So under President Bush, for eight years, you saved 450, meaning you took in 450 bucks. Okay, fine. Under President Obama, you took in 975. Under President Trump, including the energy savings, and the regulation savings, and the tax cut savings, its more than 10,000 in less than three years. Pretty good, right So for two eight-years, you had a 400, 450, and a 975. Thats eight years. 450. In less than three years, you had more than 10,000. That goes right into your pockets. Its one of the reasons our economy is doing well, because, as they say, the consumer is doing better than theyve ever done. And thats great, thats what we wanted. Weve ended the war on American energy, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on planet earth. And these maniacs want to close it up. How about going to Texas You know Beto What Remember what he said, I said, Oh, this guys a loser. You know a salesman, like if youre a great salesman, you never talk that youre a great salesman. You dont walk in and say, Well, Im a great salesman. I can sell   Any guy that does that, theyre no good. Its those quiet type that get you. You know, the ones that dont talk. So Beto, when he first got in, remember this clown He gets in, no, no, he gets in. I was made for this job, to run for president. After about two weeks, they killed him. He was gone. But you remember, he was against the Bible, he was against religion, he was against guns, and he was against oil and gas. And he comes from Texas. I said, thats a platform. Think of it. Hes against religion, hes against guns, and against oil and gas. Think of it. I dont like to bring it up because hes gone zone, but he comes from Texas. I said, Abraham Lincoln cant win in Texas with that platform. But they are, all of them, they want to close up your energy. Its a big deal. They want to close up your steel mills. They dont want your steel mills. Look at what Ive done for steel. I mean, the steel is back. We taxed all of the dump steel coming in from China and other places, and your steel mills that are doing great, theyre expanding all over the country. And they were going to be out of business within two years. The way they were going, they were gone. United States Steel is spending now billions of dollars on expansions. Every major Democrat running for president has pledged to eliminate gas powered automobiles and destroy the U.S. auto industry forever. And you know why Because they have these maniacs that say you got to go all electric. I want to have an alternative, a big alternative. Youre going to always have the alternative. And a lot of people dont know of the electric can ever catch the gas, you know And by the way, therell be different forms of energy coming along. But they want to close them up, and were not closing them up. Were going to have lots of alternatives so that you can have it from a pricing, you can have it for a lot of different reasons. Were even bringing back the old light bulb. You heard about that, right The old light bulb, which is better. I say, Why do I always look so orange You know why Because of the new light, theyre terrible. You look terrible. They cost you many, many times more, like four or five times more. And you know theyre considered hazardous waste. When a light bulb is out, youve got to bring it to a dump. So lets say, over here in Battle Creek, wheres your nearest dump Okay, thats what, a couple of hundred miles away. So every time you lose  drive a couple of hundred miles, right I said, How many people do that Nobody. What do they do They throw it in the garbage. But you know what it is, because its all gas. Its much more expensive, four or five times more. And I came into office, I did a lot of this. Sinks, showers, all of this stuff, I did a lot of it. No water comes out. You have areas where theres so much water, you dont know what to do with it. You turn on the shower, youre not allowed to have any water anymore. I mean, we do a lot of it. Dishwashers, we did the dishwasher, right You press it. Remember the dishwasher, youd press it, boom, thered be like an explosion, five minutes later you open it up, the steam pours out, the dishes. Now you press it 12 times, the women tell me, Again. You know, they give you four drops of water, and theyre in places where theres so much water, they dont know what to do with it. So we just came out with a reg on dishwashers. Were going back to the old. By the way, by the time they press it 10 times, you spend more on water, and electric. Dont forget, the whole thing is worse because youre spending all that money on electric. So were bringing back standards that are great, and better machinery that you can have the water again, right But with the light bulb, I said, Whats going on with the light bulbs A lot of people are complaining about the cost. So I had a couple of experts come in, I said, Tell me, what gives a better light Well, we liked the old light bulb better. I said, I like it better. And so what I did is you can have either one. If you want to buy the newer kind, you can. And if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind, like I do. So were bringing back the old light bulb. So its a much less expensive, it probably gives a better light. But whatever it is, and youll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb. I mean, it sounds like little, but its big stuff. Okay Its big stuff, and were doing it with a lot of other things, our dishwashers. And you know, I wont tell you one of the things, because every time I tell you, they do a big number on it. You know the one Im talking about, right Sinks, right Showers. And what goes with a sink and a shower 10 times, right 10 times. Not me, of course, not me, but you, him. But I never mention that, because one time I mentioned all three, I said, Sinks, showers, and toilets. The headline was, Trump with the toilets, toilets. Thats all they want. They dont even mention it. So I didnt mention that, okay I go off the record. But you know what Its terrible. You want to wash your hands, you turn on the sink, no water comes out. So you leave the water going 10 times as long, its the same thing. You have a shower, drip. Its no good for me. For me. You know the one thing that came out really good about being in this business They always used to say I wore a hairpiece. Its okay. I know people wear hairpieces. But they always used to say. They dont say that anymore because I have been through the worst storms. If you wear one of those suckers, you got to give it up fast because within two weeks they got you. You look handsome, dont worry about it. But in the last two decades before my election, we lost one in five auto manufacturing jobs in this country. The people are trying to impeach us for doing all of the things that theyve wanted to do for so many years. And thats why it doesnt work. We look so forward to taking it on, and it is all about cleaning the swamp, draining the swamp, and we have a very, very big, bad, dangerous swamp. Okay, thats enough of that. Thats enough. So among the very first acts that I did was to stop the deal that would have dealt a death blow to the U.S. auto industry. I withdrew from the horrible Trans Pacific Partnership. That would have ended your auto industry. A lot of people dont know that, but I do. Remember TPP We were basically ceding our auto industry to these countries that were just going to rip us off. The people that made these trade deals, its like, where do they come Like the one in Korea, that was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, This will produce 250,000 new jobs. And I said, Well, what happened He said, Well, she was right. Except it was for South Korea, not for us. No, its true. It produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea. These deals were so bad. But now theyre getting really good, and some of them are getting great, and over a period of time they are going to be phenomenal. Wait till you see the numbers that start coming out of this country over a short period of time. But we have to go through a little pain, because we have to do it, and then they all say, Were going to withdraw, and then I say, You can withdraw, I dont care. Were putting tariffs on your country. Then they say, Wed love to make a deal, sir. The new USMCA has powerful protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan where they belong. Since the election, weve created 41,000 brand new motor vehicle and parts jobs, manufacturing jobs. Remember the statement by President Obama Youd have to wave a magic wand. Remember the magic wand Because manufacturing  And I said, You know, that sounds strange. What do you do if you dont have manufacturing How do you make things Right Manufacturing jobs wont happen. Well, weve got 600,000 manufacturing jobs, and youre going to see a big, big increase. The truth is, we need more people. You know what We need more people. We need more people coming into the country, and theyre going to come in, and theyre going to come in through merit, and theyre going to love our country, and theyre going to respect our country, and theyre going to work. We do need more people. Theyre opening these massive, Foxconn in Wisconsin, theyre opening these massive plants and its hard to get people. We want people coming in, but they have to come in, only they have to come in through merit. Fiat-Chrysler recently announced a 4.5 billion investment in Michigan, including the first new auto plant in Detroit in more than a generation. And General Motors recently announced a 300 million investment at its Orion Assembly Plant right here in Michigan. Come on, General Motors, lets go. General Motors gave us a little hard time with one building. I wasnt happy about that. That was the only building I had a problem within the whole car industry, right Right You know the one Im talking about. I didnt like that. Anyway, but theyre spending money, you know, what can I tell you But these companies are coming in, a lot of the foreign companies are coming because they have to. I say, You have to, or were not trading with you anymore. Because we had such big deficits with these countries. With Japan, we had a 68 billion deficit. I said, Shinzo, hes great Prime Minister of Japan. But he said, But nobody has ever asked us to do this. I said, Im asking you. They are building many, many plants. Theyre building many plants now in the United States, the Japanese. And after years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. Is that okay We were surrounded with globalists. You know, they think its okay. You open a plant in some country that you never heard of, they make your product, they send it. In the meantime, they close all their factories here. Were not doing that anymore. Those are globalists. They think its wonderful to have deficits. I dont. They think its great. Its a great thing to have deficits. No, those are globalists. The globalists are passe.  our first duty and our one true allegiance is to you, the American people, before anybody else. We must care for our own- We must care for our own citizens first Democrat immigration policies are resulting in brutal assaults and wicked murders against innocent Americans. I dont even know whats happening. Its terrible. And weve moved out thousands and thousands of MS13 thugs out of our country. And we have agreements now with Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. They didnt use to take them back. If we had a murderer, then we should get them the hell out. We dont really want them in our prisons and take care of them for 50, 60 years. We want to bring them back. They wouldnt take them. The planes used to go around and around, dont land, dont land. With us, they land. We worked out deals with every one of them. We stopped giving them all the aid. Were giving them all this money and then they said, Were not going to let you land. Were not going to let you take them back. I said, Thats okay. 500 million, we were giving them. I said, now we give them 5 we give them nothing. All of a sudden they said, We would love to have them back. We would love it. Its wonderful to have them back. In June, two illegal aliens in Sandusky, Michigan were convicted of sadistically beating and stabbing a woman to death with a kitchen knife. Then, they hid her body in a water drain. A criminal alien with two previous deportations was just arrested in Michigan and convicted of brutally beating and strangling to death, a single mother of five young children. Its happening all the time. Far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities, which deliberately release dangerous, violent criminal aliens out of the jails and directly onto your streets. We had a great election in North Carolina recently, two great congressmen got elected, you dont hear about it, when they win, you dont ever hear about it, just a few months ago. Two great people and they got elected and they got elected because I went in and said, Talk about the fact that you have sanctuary cities and they had some horrible crimes happening from those sanctuary cities. Soon as I mentioned that, boom, they went up like rocket ships and they won their elections and it was great. Great thing. The sanctuary cities are a disaster and let me tell you, the people of California, they dont like sanctuary cities either. Theyre stuck with them because they have crazy politicians. Earlier this year, authorities in the sanctuary jurisdiction of Kent County, Michigan, anybody know Kent County Released an illegal alien charged with assault with intent to murder after he repeatedly and viciously stabbed a man in the head with a broken bottle. They let him go to roam free in Michigan communities. If you want to end sanctuary cities in Michigan, if you want to protect your families from criminal aliens, if you want to have a safe life, frankly, its so crazy what theyre doing. You wouldnt even believe it. You have only one choice in 2020, you must vote Republican. Thank you. Im surprised. As you know, you do have sanctuary cities in Michigan. I was almost surprised to hear it, but you have them. Its one of those progressive things They think theyre doing a wonderful favor for the world. And now were getting these prosecutors that, you murder somebody, they give you two months, they fight that you dont even have to go to jail. Whats going on is crazy. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, illegal crossings are down 75% since may and weve ended catch and release. Weve ended it. We couldve ended it so easily. Its called the loophole. You catch him and then you release him into a country. Thats what you had to do by law. And if you dont do that, they arrest the border patrol people. You believe this The border patrol people were in more danger than the criminal aliens coming in and some of these people are not good people. These are the people because look, when you have a caravan of eight or 10,000 people, a lot of those people, do you think that Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, do you think theyre sending us their finest I dont think so. Alright. How about the lottery That was a Schumer deal. Chuck Schumer, crying Chuck, crying Chuck Schumer. I used to be a big contributor to him, he used to kiss my ass, Chuck Schumer. Hed do anything. He wouldve done anything for me. Anything I asked him, get Schumer on the phone, You do this, you do that. You get him on the phone, that son of a bitch. He would have done, I didnt need anything, but he would have done anything. Now its like, The prisoner has not acted-. Give me a break. Give me a break. Find out how much money did I give a raise to Chuck Schumer and Chuck, give all that money back please. Carolyn Maloney, give that money back. Every penny should come back. They act so pompous. They act so righteous. Theyre not righteous. Theyre not righteous. Theyre bad people. The far left Democrats have never been more extreme than they are now. Democrats are pushing a socialist takeover of healthcare that will take away your coverage and take away your doctor. 180 million people are going to lose. A lot of people here now have healthcare finally under us thats phenomenal. And thats what you want. They want to take it away, 180. They want you to go to a hospital ward someplace and sit there all night. I dont think so. Not in this group. And you know what Some people, its good so people, but can you imagine They want to take away 180 million people, great, private, highly negotiated healthcare where you have your own doctor. Remember Obama 28 times, You can have your doctor, you can have your plan. Didnt work out that way, did it I think we should impeach him for that. Lets impeach him, for that, for the IRS scandal, for the guns. Remember the guns, he was giving them to anybody that wanted them. He gave guns to the worst people in the world and then they didnt have them registered, right Not to good. Impeach him. Why didnt the Republicans impeach him Those were really, how about giving around 1.8 billion in cash How about that By the way, I ended the Iran nuclear deal. I hope you happy, much different country. But how about giving Iran 1.8 billion in cash. Many big planes going over to Iran, loaded up to the ceiling with cash. You know what 1.8 billion, you ever see like at a casino, 1 million wrapped up Its a big pile of stuff, thats a million. Now multiply it, 1.8 billion in cash he gave. So, why is he allow to do that Did anybody try to impeach him for that Everybody knew it was wrong. Republicans will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions and we will protect your preexisting physicians. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb, right up until the moment of birth. Right That is why Ive asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. And thats what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream. And thats really what it is. Were also the party of the great Abraham Lincoln. A lot of people forget that, but we have to bring it up. To protect the health and safety of our citizens, we awarded 100 million to improve water infrastructure in Flint. How badly was Flint Who were the geniuses that did that to you You have clean water coming into Flint. They had to pay a very tiny little fee. So instead, they go into this horrible, horrible, really polluted water and the water comes out of there. They spend hundreds of millions of dollars to save like a couple of bucks, and the water was so terrible and it hurt the people. It hurt the people. But were getting it fixed. And I know your previous governor was a Republican, but I was not a big fan of his. I was not, but Im not a big fan of the one that cant fix the potholes either. Were committed to ensuring America has the cleanest air in the cleanest water on planet earth, and thats what its about. Its about clean air and its about clean, beautiful water. And its about keeping our industry, not closing it because of the ridiculous Paris Climate Accord. Hows Paris doing I dont think too well. Hows Paris doing with the yellow vests The yellow vests You know why Because they raise gasoline prices so they could send them money all over the world to countries that the people in France never heard of. Its not working out too well. Were lowering prices. Were lowering taxes. Were making it possible. I mean, look at gas prices now. Look at gas prices. I recognize Israels true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Big deal. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized. Member, I would like to apologize. I would like to apologize. Nah, we dont apologize. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Michigan. Youre getting your auto industry back. At stake in our present battle is the survival of the American nation. If you want your children to grow up, a land of safety, its really, we want a land of safety, justice. Well, I dont know. When I look at those FBI reports we got out, we got to clean up a lot. What theyve done to hurt people, what theyve done to hurt with Comey and these horrible people, what theyve done to hurt people. I think one of the best things I did as president, a lot of people would say, With all what weve done for the economy and, but one of the best things is firing James Comeys ass out of there. Boy, those reports are kept. Did you see the other day Well, ah, ah. First time now he said, in other words, hes 50% there folks. Hes hit the golden pond. Anyway, so what were doing is, were doing things that are going to make our victory, its like a tree. We need that extra four years. Weve done so much, even Right to Try. You know Right to Try People were traveling, theyre terminally ill, theyre traveling all over the world. We have the best medical in the world, the best doctors, the best labs, best hospital. Theyre traveling all over the world, to try and get, because it takes years to get something approved. And I said, Wait a minute folks, why arent we doing this And theyve been trying to do it for 49 years. They couldnt get it done. Not that easy. The drug companies didnt want the liability, the country didnt want the liability, the insurance companies didnt want the liability. I said, Heres what we do. Well sign an agreement with the people where youre exculpated from all liability. Huh Thats a good idea. And its a very strong agreement so we cant get sued. But I said, Listen, they were worried theyre going to hurt people. I said, These people are terminally ill. Theyre terminally ill, and so we do it now. Nine months ago, all the legislators at the 49 years, so if somebodys sick, they dont have to go to Asia, theyre have to go to Europe. Or if youre poor, you go home and you die. Now what happens Very simple. You sign that document, they work it out. You wouldnt believe how many lives are being saved. Its incredible. Its incredible. Im very proud of it, Right to Try. I hope you dont need it. You dont want it. You dont want it. Okay But if you do, its there. With your help, we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact the greatest trade deals ever made. Theyll result in more products, proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine. What were doing is unbelievable. Were so far ahead of everybody. What weve done in the last three years with the FDA and even the speed of what were doing, it would take 12, 13, 14 years to get things approved. Its down to a much smaller number, but were finding new cures for childhood cancer and we are ending the AIDS epidemic in America. Weve started the process. Who wouldve thought that In 10 years, its a 10 year process, we will have ended the AIDS epidemic in America and it could have been been started before I came to office. It was just wasted time. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. Theyre incredible, and that includes ICE. You know how tough these people are These are great patriots. They love our country. Even the sheriffs alone for, some of the people that theyre dealing with. These guys walk into the golems nest and in some cases they just swing it out. They can have it. They love it. These are great. If we didnt have them, and I told you before, theyre taking out bad, bad, bad people by the thousands, especially MS13 gang members. Whos going to do that Whos going to do that Anybody in the front row I dont know. What about you Youre a tough guy. You might do it. You could do it. I dont know. You might, yeah, you can. What you like Were going to recruit you. I think you could handle yourself. Now, these are tough people, right You got to be tough. Then they get accused, theyre too tough. Oh, theyre too tough. You have some of these guys. They knife people. They dont even need a gun because its more painful. They knife the two young girls, 16 years old. Beautiful. They cut them up into pieces because it was more painful than shooting them. These are animals. And then Nancy Pelosi said, I shouldnt use the term animal. And by the way, she ought to go home and take care of her district where the homeless is all over the place and the tents and the filth and the garbage is a eroding right into the Pacific ocean and into their beaches. She ought to go and take care of her district in San. Do you see whats going on And it rains and its filth and its needles and its drugs and its, you know what. Its everything and it goes right into those storm sewers. Storm, not sanitary, storm and it goes right out into the Pacific ocean into the beaches and we fine Los Angeles and San Francisco, but weve just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what theyre doing. And Nancy Pelosi is playing games. She ought to go home and take care of the homeless and take care of the filth and everything. San Francisco was the most beautiful city. When you look at whats happened with the tents all over the place, where the police officers are getting sick just from walking the beat, theyre getting sick. Diseases are coming back that this world hasnt seen for 30, 40, 50 years. Its a disgrace. She ought to get back and take care of her district instead of wasting time on this nonsense. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto and its always going to be up there. They want to take everything down. They dont want Thomas Jefferson anymore. They dont want anything. Thats a terrible thing and we fight for it, now. We fight. These words will never be taken off. I dont care where I am. If Im up there, if Im down here, I dont know, but well be fighting. Well never take these words off, in God we trust. We stand on the shoulders of generations of Michigan Patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line. Its the place where General Motors, Chrysler and Kellogg transformed the nation. It gave us Motown, the Mustang and the might of the American Midwest. This is the American mid west. And Michigan is the state where generations of strong, tough and proud American workers made this into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. And we are making it bigger, better and stronger than ever before, by far. Loyal citizens like you help build this country. And together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you. The American people, the Democrats took the people of Michigan for granted, but with us, you will never be forgotten again. The forgotten men and women of this country will never, ever be forgotten again. And Im fighting for you. And I love doing it with everything that I have. And I will never, ever stop. And you know that. I will say I could have a much easier life. Some people say, Why is he doing it You know why Im doing it because were doing the thing and look what were doing is were bringing back our country again. Were respected again, were respected again. We are so respected, you dont even know how respected. I went to NATO where we were being ripped off because the other countries, you have 29 countries, and the other countries werent paying their bills. They were delinquent in real estate. I noticed people are using that word. Ive been using it for the last year. Its like a real estate trend. Thats when they dont pay their rent, right Well, they werent paying and you have to see this chart, until I got there. They got to pay and they said, Well, does that mean you wont protect us I said, You dont want the answer to that question. Over the last, and the Secretary General Stoltenberg, over the last period of just two years, I raised, not from us, nothing from us, 130 billion, but thats nothing and over a short period of time they will be paying 530 billion more. All of those countries. My biggest fan in the world is Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO. He says, I never thought this could. Im telling you, if you look, its like 15 years just down. President Obama would go there, make a speech, Id like to thank everybody for being here. Thanks. Look, great job. Sayonara. Goodbye. Bush, they all did. Nobody ever asked for money. We were spending for 100% of NATO. Were protecting Europe. They rip us off on trade, right They rip us off like crazy. We lose hundreds of billions of dollars on trade. Were changing that, but its a long time. Its been going on a long time. They dont take your product. They dont take your cars. They dont take your farm product. They dont take your medical machines. We do a big business. They sell us. We dont sell them because they put restrictions. We have better equipment than them, but they make it so that our equipment doesnt qualify. Its called artificial barriers or non-monetary barriers. Its brutal what they do. Im telling you, theyre as bad as China, just smaller. They are as bad as China, just smaller and now Chinas doing great. Were very happy, but we have to do something with that. We have to take care of our people. We cant be ripped off by these countries, so NATO is ripping us off militarily, but now theyre starting to pay big money and thats good. We want to help them. We want to be there with them, but they have to pay. They have to pay. 530 billion and the fake news doesnt even want to talk about it. They dont want to talk about it. They talk about other things. They dont want to talk about that. When youd get a chance though, just a couple of weeks, maybe you could say over a short period of time, NATO countries will be paying 530 billion more. More, not total. More. Hows that Good. Thats not too bad. Nobody else could do that, I guarantee. I wont tell you what took place in those closed door meetings. Some of them dont like me. They like Obama. Germany likes Obama. A lot of these countries, France, they like Obama. Its embarrassing. In France, President Obama is more popular than President Trump. Well, I should be. I just taxed their wine and champagne coming into our country because theyre ripping us off on the internet. Okay. If I ever become more popular, that means Im not doing my job. You should say hes out. Its true. I could be loved in Germany. I could be loved in Germany. Oh, theyd love me. My father came from Germany, parents and I could be loved in Germany. Theyd like me so much, but then Im not doing my job for you. Have to do it. Have to do it. With your help, your devotion, your drive, were going to keep on working. Were going to keep on fighting. We are going to keep on winning, winning, winning because we are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation, under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Michigan, the best is yet to come. Great state. Great state. You better remember all those jobs in a year from now, I tell you. Ill say, That state let me down. I dont think thats going to happen. Im hearing very good thing. You know the interesting thing, before it was like a promise. I said Im going to bring car back. Im going to bring this. Im going to be pres, it was all like, its good. You believed me, I was successful, all this, but now weve done it. We have done more than I promised, no politics. I promised, weve done more than we promised. No politician I think, has ever done that. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Michigan. Thank you."
Tupelo,Nov1,2019,"Well, thank you very much. And hello, Tupelo. This is great to be with you tonight, the great state of Mississippi. The great state of Mississippi, and by the way, the birthplace of a gentleman, not too many people heard of him, Elvis Presley. But to be with thousands of incredible patriots who put their faith in God, family and country. Right Four days from now, this state will head to the polls and vote to continue our extraordinary progress with your next governor, Republican Tate Reeves. Great guy. Great guy. Under Republican leadership, jobs are booming, confidence is soaring, wages are rising, crime is falling, and our nation is stronger than ever before. Were now an economic powerhouse. Weve never been in a position like it. Weve rebuilt our military and we have financial strength. And by the way, for those of you with a thing called 401ks, the stock market hit, today, another all-time historic high. Unemployment in Mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded, ever recorded. Thats not bad. Thats not bad when youre on the debate stage and you say, We have the best economy weve ever had. We have the best military weve ever had, the best unemployment and employment numbers weve ever had. Said, Got the best president weve ever had. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Four more years Four more years Four more years Four more years Four more years Four more years Four more years Thank you very much. And very importantly, weve confirmed more than 158 brand new, beautiful federal judges to uphold our constitution as written. In a very short while, well have 182 federal judges. President Obama left us 142. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Can you believe that Youre supposed to leave none when you leave office, but that didnt work out too well. And just days ago, the United States brought the worlds number one terrorist leader to justice. We have great military. It was very, very depleted. When I came into office, it was very, very depleted, but it aint depleted anymore. Yep. al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader Look, youve heard about it for a long time. I kept saying, Where is al-Baghdadi Thats the one I want. Where is he And then, by the way, the following day, we got number two. I dont know if you read about that. But he was the founder and the leader of ISIS, and hes dead. And Baghdadi, he was a Savage and soulless monster, but his reign of terror is over. American special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell, I guess you could say. He spent his last miserable moments on Earth cowering and trembling and crying in fear of the American warrior that was right there going right up. No enemy stands a chance against the righteous bite of the United States military, and Mississippi loves our military, that I can tell you. And our military loves Mississippi. America is winning again, and America is all, over the world, respected again. Its about time. But while were creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Democrat party has gone completely insane. The radical left is determined to transform America into a country you would not recognize. We are the ones standing in their way, and we will never get out of their way. It will be easy. From even before we won the election, the far-left Democrats and the fake news media right back there Look at all of them, oh. Its too bad we get such good ratings because if we didnt, they wouldnt be here. Look at how many. Its like the Academy Awards before it failed. Right And you know why it failed Because they disrespected us. But the media and the Democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership, trying to impose their will and to thwart American democracy by any means necessary. You see whats going on. First, they engineered the Russia hoax. That was a total hoax, the single greatest lies ever foisted upon the American people. Then the Mueller witch hunt, it never ended. With 18 angry Democrats and an unlimited budget, lets go get him. That didnt work out too well, did it That fizzled. And a lot of bad people along the way. And now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi-  and shifty Adam Schiff, Shifty. And the media are continuing with the deranged impeachment witch hunt. This is one I never thought Id be involved in. The word impeachment To me, its a dirty word, not a good word. Totally phony deal. They know it. Everybody knows it, and thats why weve never had greater support than we have right now. Its true. And if you think you have a lot of people in this room, all you have to do is go outside. Youll see a lot more people trying to get in. So if anybody wants to give up your seat, please just walk out. Anybody want to leave Because there really is. Theres no place better to have a rally, to have a good time, and to also, at the same time, be very serious than at a Trump rally, especially on Friday night in Mississippi. We could have done this one on Monday night. I said, Lets do Friday. Right Yesterday, the Democrats voted to potentially nullify the votes of 63 million Americans, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. Theyve been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment I won. But the people here that are highly sophisticated, though, long before I won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, the horrible newspaper, fake, fake, fake Washington Post, declared, The campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun. At least they gave us 19 minutes. Yesterdays vote by the radical Democrats is an attack on democracy itself. But Ill tell you, the Republicans are really strong, the strongest Ive ever seen them, the most unified Ive ever seen them. Right The most unified Ive ever seen them. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, and extremism. The Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote many do-nothing Democrats out of office in 2020. Make no mistake. They are coming after the Republican party and me because Im fighting for you. They dont like it. This is different. Theyve never had anything like this. Well, theyve never had an election like 2016 either, have they They never have. Theyve never quite figured it out. Youre the man. And they know they cant win, so lets try and impeach him. How about that crazy representative, Al Green, right You know, we got to impeach him because we cant beat him. I dont think so. Right I dont think so. Al Green, hes another beauty. The Democrats, the media, and the deep state are desperate to stop us. And its not me, its us. Its all of us. Its 63 million, but its much more than 63 million. Much more. And right now, our numbers are higher than theyve ever been before. Theyve never been this high. But they want to stop us because they know we are here, and thats what were doing, and thats whats taking up so much time. Were draining the swamp in Washington. Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the fact that all of their spying Spying. They actually spied on my campaign. Can you believe it I mean, you know, they try and say, Well, we were actually just checking things out. Oh, thats wonderful. The lying, the falsifying over the past three years plus, before I ever even announced they were spying. I guess they knew we were going to win, right But over that past more than three years is finally being exposed. And remember this, that truth is a force of nature. Desperate to conceal their misdeeds, the Democrats are now attacking us for calling out the grave corruption of the Bidens, just like they melted down when we pointed out crooked Hillarys shocking and very many misdeeds. 33,000 emails. 33,000 emails disappeared, but she said they only had to do with her working out at her daughters wedding. 33. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Shes a beauty. How about last week Did you hear I dont know who Tulsi Gabbard is, but I know one thing. Shes not an agent of Russia. And Jill Stein, shes a greenie. Thats fine. We love the environment, everybody in this room. You know, right now we have the cleanest air and the cleanest water that weve ever had, and yet were number one in the world in energy, by far. We took over. But I dont know Jill Stein. She ran last time. I dont know, but I know shes not an agent of Russia. And when Hillary made those statements, two statements, both of them, They work for Russia, theyre agents of I said, You know, when she made that statement about me three years ago, it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement. She made it about them. Everybody laughed because of what we proved. But Ill tell you what, these are very bad people. These are very dishonest people, and the media is worse than all of them. But think about the preposterous hoax the Democrats are now trying to peddle. Ive just beaten, with no Look, look, we didnt have too much political experience. I did a good job, built lots of buildings all over the place, had great success in show business. Just did one show. It was called The Apprentice, and it was a big success. 14 seasons. And when I left, Crazy Arnold took over. It didnt do too well. It was dead. It was dead from the first episode. I saw him, I said, Oh, its terrible. What have they done to this beautiful show Arnold But think of it. Ive just beaten, with no political experience, the Clinton dynasty, the Bush dynasty, the President Barack Hussein Obama dynasty. And President Obama worked harder at defeating me than crooked Hillary Clinton did, right He was all over the place. Its the only time Ive actually seen him work hard, when it came to trying to beat Trump. True. True. Remember he said Remember he said, He will not be president Well, that didnt work out so well. And then they figured they could take us out a different way, very dishonesty, right, with the lying and the spying and the leaking. And we are kicking their ass. Ill tell you. In the delusional Democrat fantasy, Im now supposed to be afraid of someone called 1% Joe. I used to call him 1% because you could never get 1% in the primaries. Then he got brought out by Obama out of the trash heap, became vice president. But weve now named him Very Slow, Sleepy Joe. Very slow. Hes gotten slower and slower. Im afraid if he gets a nomination, hell be so slow well have the lowest-rated debates in history as opposed to the highest-rated debates in history against crooked Hillary. In fact, I dont even think that Sleepy Joe will get it. But many people are running. So, you know, its so early. I dont want to talk about their campaign. Oh, did you hear Beto Beto Did you hear Beto Beto. Oh, that poor bastard. Well, poor, pathetic guy. He was pathetic. Remember the arms a-flailing Remember that You know, he ran against Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz won. He spent almost 100 million dollars, and Ted Cruz And I helped Ted, and we campaigned together, and it was good. But I used to watch him. Then when he came onto the really big stage, this crazy stage, I noticed he was flailing with the arms, and he was standing on tables. He was standing on countertops. I said, Does he ever stand on the floor and speak But hes waving his arms and going crazy, and I said, What the hell is he doing What is he on And do you remember he made the statement that he was born for this Anybody that says he was born for this, theyre in trouble. I used to have guys come into my office, Sir, Im the greatest salesman. Nobody can sell You know, the truth is anybody that says theyre a great salesman, usually theyre not a very good salesman. Its true. Its those sneaky ones in the back that dont talk, that you dont know about. Theyre the ones. But Beto was nasty, and he said that he was born for it, like he was born from heaven. He came down. And if thats the case, some really bad things happen, because he made a total fool out of himself. And he came out of Texas, the great state of Texas. He came out of Texas, a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be. So he was a nasty guy, but he had a couple of policies that dont work well in the state of Texas. Right He was against religion. He was against you having a gun. And he was against oil. So you come from Texas, you dont like religion, you dont like oil, and you dont have guns. I dont know. Thats not a good combination in the state of Texas. Thats not good in Mississippi, either. I dont know its that good anywhere. Nah, he went back home to Texas, and hopefully we wont be hearing about him for a long time. Its amazing how cold you could get so quickly, but he was a nasty guy. But in the twist Oh, Alabama. Love Alabama. I love Alabama. I love Alabama. Its a great place. But in the very twisted and corrupt world of Adam Schiff, after beating the entire political establishment, and that means Bush and that means Clinton and that means Obama, they have me supposedly saying to myself, Well, lets see. I got a guy named Sleepy Joe Biden. How do I beat him How do I beat him How do I beat this guy Hes such a great. Clinton, she was easy. Right Obama was easy. The Bush dynasty was. But sleepy Joe, Im worried about, right So then I said to myself, Gee, I guess theres only one way. Lets call up Ukraine for help. These people are sick. These people are sick. Now, these dishonest people will take the last little sliver and the first little sliver and theyll put it, because theyre so damn dishonest, and theyll just say-  Lets use Ukraine for help. Thats what theyre going to say. And they wont show the laughter, and they wont show the sarcasm, and they wont show the fun because theyre the most dishonorable people almost on earth. Its a disgrace. But we say it anyway. And heres the good news. The people get it. So they have a brand new president in Ukraine. Good guy, by the way. And I call a brand new person, a man I have no idea who he is, and Im on a phone, right And I know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of country, many people listen. And Im on the phone, and they want me to say to this brand new president, just got there, called to congratulate him, Please, could you help me please I dont know who he is. I didnt know his name until I looked down the card, I see. And hes a nice guy, and hopefully hes going to root out corruption because Ukraine has tremendous corruption problems. And one of the reasons I held up money, very important, corruption. But the other reason Why isnt Germany and France and UK and all of these European nations that are right there Why arent they doing things that theyre supposed to do Why is it always the United States So I made this call, had this wonderful call, and the transcript proves it was, as I said, perfect. It was perfect. It wasnt like almost It was perfect. It was totally appropriate. I made it at the behest of people to say, Could you call and say hello Now Im an honest person, anyway. But do you think, when Im making a call to a newly-elected president of a country, that I would say something improper when I know there are so many people listening on the line Many people. Whoever the hell wants to listen, they listen, and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people. And remember, the new president of Ukraine is speaking to the United States of America, the president. I guarantee hes got a lot of people listening, too. These people are sick.  no pressure. They must think were nuts, to be honest. Its all a phony deal, this whole impeachment scam, to try to undermine the 2020 election and to de-legitimatize one of the greatest elections, maybe the greatest  I mean, lets give George Washington credit, but everybody expected he was going to win, that weve ever had. So my phone call, which was totally perfect and appropriate, and if you want to read the transcript, you see how perfect it was, but they dont quit. But what you should do is take a look at the behavior of Sleepy Joe. So I quote, I said  Let me act like him. Ive got to speak really slow though, and  I said, Youre not getting a billion. I looked at them and I said, Im leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor isnt fired, youre not getting the money. You understand Youre not getting the money. Then he goes, at the end  I didnt know he had this kind of energy. He goes, Well, son of a bitch, he got fired. You know, in a certain way, I was impressed because, I mean, I didnt think he had the energy, the brain power. Its turned out he doesnt. By the way, hes dropping like a rock. When youre at 1%, theres always a reason. He should be there fairly soon. As you know, the Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden got fired after threatening to withhold, I think it was 1 billion or something in aid, was the prosecutor investigating his sons company, that was paying Hunter Biden, a guy just got thrown out of the Navy  He was paying them millions of dollars, even though, working for an energy company, he had no experience with energy. He knew less about it than this young  How old are you Six. This young, beautiful person in front of me. Six. And this young six-year-old is smarter, so I think Id basically go with her. So what is it all about Its called a payoff, but you know what The fake news, they apologize. I watched this horrible guy who gets lousy ratings, Anderson Cooper. Well, the hatred, I mean, between him and Fredo. Youve got Fredo and  Thats Cuomo, Fredo. I call him Fredo, like from the movie. Now I watched Anderson Cooper and I watched him apologize for even asking the question to Biden. The good news is Biden didnt know too much about what the hell he was talking about. Remember Biden said, I dont know these people. I dont know them. I dont know them.  were dealing with life, right He never spoke to him. Unfortunately, the next day  In the world of the internet, in the world of smart people  Thats why I like Beto, he wasnt smart, couldnt handle it. I told my wife, I said, See, its not so easy. I told our great First Lady tonight, who people love. They love her. When Beto quit, he quit like a dog. When he quit I said, See, people think this is easy. This isnt easy, but it just worked out that way. But Biden said, I never met the people, never met the gentlemen. Unfortunately, in about 10 seconds, a picture came out where theyre playing golf together, but he never met him. So now youll ask him, hell say, No, we played around a golf. We were together for three hours. I never mentioned the fact that theyre paying my son millions. Oh, no, no, no.  Well, they might be watching us. I guess they do watch us. He used to interview me. He was so nice. Prior to running for politics, he was so nice to me. It was like they were love fests, but I dont want anything to do with him. They were love fests. What a thought. Hes weak. Hes a weak person, but theyre all weak. But let me just tell you something. We need honesty with our media. We need honesty, because the New York Times, the Washington Post  And by the way, I dont know, you probably read it. We threw them out at the White House. We dont show them anymore. If somebody wants to go and buy them we threw them out. And they came into my office and then I got to get back to this guy. Wheres Hunter Wheres Hunter We had a tee shirt made, Wheres Hunter Wheres Hunter Poor Hunter. He then came out, he did the Morning Show. That was the last weve seen of Hunter. That wasnt good. The morning of his fathers very bad debate, but its, where is Hunter But before I say the final thing on Hunter and then we put him to rest for a while, we got rid of the Washington Post and the failing New York Times. We got rid of them, right We dont have them in the White House. I said, No, you could  People can go out and buy them, but we dont  We used to have them stacked up, and Id go in and Id see a meeting with my people and theyre dealing with China, South Korea, or somebody. And Id go into these offices Id see 10 or 15 of them packed up all over the place, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. I keep trying to figure out whos worse. And one day its the Times, one day its the Post. Its like top each other, theyre so bad. Its so phony. In my opinion, its virtually corrupt. Ive never seen it. You never have a good story. I mean, even when we got al-Baghdadi, the Washington Post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric. Where did that come from The other thing, if Obama would have done it  because, look. This guy built ISIS. The caliphate, it was the size physically of Ohio, the state of Ohio, the great state of Ohio. Thats a big, lot of land. 7 million people, and they were the ones, the orange jumpsuits. I called a lot of the parents after we did this and I talked to them and they were  How can you be happy But they were so thrilled that we got this animal. They were so thrilled. But you know what And you know what We dont do it for  We do it because its right. That story was a massive story. That was the biggest, maybe the biggest, one of the biggest, ever. Bigger than anything. That story disappeared so fast. Done. And thats okay. I didnt do it for the story. I did it because its the right thing to do. But if I were a Democrat, theyd be talking about that story for weeks. With me, they dont even want to  They actually played it down. And actually, and Im happy about this, Conan the dog got more publicity than me. And Im very happy with that. Im very  Conan is incredible. And Conans coming to the White House in a few weeks. But it is true. Did you ever see a story disappear so fast I mean, if Obama had that story, that thing would be going on for another seven months. Theyd be talking about his bravery. Oh, so bravery. But again, 142 judges he gave us. Remember that. How can you be a great  They always say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges. We got two Supreme Courts. Great ones. Great judge. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, great judges. By the way, did you ever see any human being treated worse than now-Justice Kavanaugh Did anybody ever Was any human being by these people, these horrible, horrible people that we have to deal with Anyway, just to finish. So Hunter then goes to China. Now Im dealing with China right now. They dont like me too much. They dream about the day when somebody else  And would they like to have  How about this You give this son, who has zero experience with investing, too, you give him 1.5 billion to invest, meaning he makes millions and millions of dollars, and the biggest guys on Wall Street cant get it. He walks out with 1.5 billion. And then there are other places also, I understand. Folks, its disgraceful that the press doesnt cover it for what it is. Its a payoff. Its a payoff. And how would you like to have Sleepy Joe, with the son getting all of this money from China, become president and take over the China deal They are not liking me. They had the worst year that theyve had in 57 years. Their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs and they want to make a deal because those tariffs have given us millions of dollars and billions now, billions and billions of dollars. Were taking billions and billions of dollars, and you know what were doing with some of it Just a small portion, but 100%, theyre taking care of  Our farmers got 16 billion last year and 12 billion the year before because they targeted our farmers, because they know the farmers love Trump and Trump loves the farmers. So they targeted them and they brought the 16 billion down to practically nothing. And they thought our farmers would say, Oh, we dont like Trump. They did just the opposite. They said, We know hes doing the right thing because weve been ripped off for so many years. But I said to him, I said to Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Purdue, a great guy I said, Sonny, how much did they spend buying our corn and soy beans and all of our agricultural product He said, Sir, 16 billion. I said, Good, Ill make it up. And were going to have a lot leftover. So we will have, pretty soon, over 100 billion in money paid into the United States Treasury by a country that never gave us 25 cents. They only took. They only took. So when I said to the farmers, Were going to send you 16 billion, and its already been sent. And its been split into 12 billion the year before. I mean, think of that, 28 billion. I said, Compliments of China. And we had a lot left over. Not bad, right Not bad. You think Obama would do that I dont think so. You think Hillary would do that I dont think so. You think Sleepy Joe would do that I dont think so. He wouldnt know what youre talking about. On Tuesday, the proud people of Mississippi will send Democrats a clear message. Its very important for this reason, as well as the fact that you have a great gentleman in your midst. But you have to reject their extremism and their socialism and their corruption. Theyre corrupt. Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician. You know when he made that phony speech where he made up a really horrible speech and said that I said it, I said, Oh, Im going to sue him. They said, Sir, Im sorry. You cant. Hes got total immunity because he made it in Congress. Can you believe this But heres the good news. At least we have a forum, we have a place we can talk so everyone knows whats going on. A bunch of phony people, but this is why we have to send a signal and why you have to make Tate Reeves your great, new Republican  Right Republican governor, right Hey, hes a great guy, too. And all I know is hes loved and respected by your current governor, because Phil is some piece of work. Phil is so confident. I wanted Phil to run for a certain office, then I wanted him to do something. Ive tried to get him, but some guys are confident. Phil said, No sir, Ive been doing this all my life. I love the people. He built the most beautiful African-American museum. Phil, hes the greatest, but he built the most beautiful  But hes got confidence. And he said, No sir, Id been doing it. I dont really want to do that. In other words, he said, Thats enough.  Oh, we love our police, right I love our police. We love our police. Hell oppose sanctuary cities, which is just terrible. Theyre terrible. And Tate will always defend your Second Amendment. So Tates running against a liberal Democrat named Jim Hood. Now all I know about Jim Hood is he fought very hard to elect crooked Hillary Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama. Isnt that nice He wanted Obama to win so badly and then he wanted Hillary to win. And thats not the kind of guy we need here. Not in Mississippi. Hes supported by extreme leftists like Stacey Abrams, who, by the way went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentlemen from the great state of Georgia, Brian Kemp. And they came in with  Oh, they brought them all. They had President Obama, they had Michelle Obama, they had Oprah Winfrey. They came in, and all he had was Donald Trump, and we won. We won, fairly easily. But Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote. Do you believe this I mean, some of these people, they want to give them education. They want to give them this. They want to give them free healthcare. They want to give these people, that come into our country illegally all benefits, and he opposed our travel ban, which is so important that we won in the United States Supreme Court to keep terrorists the hell out of our country. And Jim Hood went to the United Nations and opposed your right to self-defense. If you dont want a far left Democrat running Mississippi  Wait a minute. Hows this guy I cant believe this is a competitive race. Its embarrassing. Im talking to Mississippi. Im talking to Mississippi. I cant believe it. I dont think that hes going to be the right guy. I think the guy that you want is Tate Reeves. Hes going to be fantastic. He will be a great, great governor. Tate, come on up. Tate. Thank you, Tate. Tuesday, go out and vote for Tate. Hell never let you down. And dont kid yourself. Your Second Amendment is under attack, but not with him. Its under attack. So were also joined tonight by a man who is truly, and Ive sort of said it a lot, but hes been a great governor and he loves your state. He loves the people of this great state, Governor Phil Bryant. Wheres Phil Come up, Phil. Come up. Oh, hes central casting. Look at him. Come here, Phil. Thank you, Phil. Thank you. Thank you, my Phil. What a job. What a great job. You have to continue that whole thing going forward. So another man whos a warrior is a friend of mine. Whenever theres a problem, hes there. Hes always there. Hell be right at the front. He is tough. He is smart. Hes brilliant, actually. And he loves this state and he loves you people. Senator Roger Wicker. Roger. Thanks, Roger. Thank you, Roger. And somebody, Ill call her up because, believe it or not, shes running with me. She just ran. I said, Cindy, you just ran. You just won. She said, No, I have to do it again. Shes running in 2020. I thought shed have six years. I said, Cindy, its only like a year. Cindy Hyde-Smith. Shes incredible. Shes tough and smart and strong, and shes with us all the way. Cindy Hyde-Smith.  Trent Kelly, Michael Guest. Incredible people. And your next Lieutenant Governor, Delbert Hosemann. Your next Attorney General, Lynn Fitch. Your next Secretary of State, Michael Watson. Great people. Your next State Treasure, David McRae. State Auditor, Shad White. Agriculture Commissioner, Andy Gipson. Insurance Commissioner, Mike Chaney. And former governor, a man that nobodys ever heard of in this room, Im sure, but the truth is hes a legend in politics and a great guy. Hes a great guy, Haley Barbour.  Hourly earnings are up 9% in Mississippi since the election. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories in our country. Under my administration, weve already added nearly 10,000 new factories, and many more are coming in as we speak. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts on average 2,000 to 2,500 per family, bringing almost 1 trillion back home to our shores. Whats happening You couldnt get the money. The big companies, they couldnt get their money back both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint. They brought back almost 1 trillion now because of us. All put to work. We slashed the largest number in history of job-killing regulations, and we ended the war on American energy. We are now the number one producer of energy by far anywhere in the world. For decades, you saw corrupt politicians take money from lobbyists to impose catastrophic trade deals. Mississippi lost 40% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and Chinas entrance into the World Trade Organization. Two of the worst deals ever made by our country. 100,000 Mississippi jobs were wiped away just like that, and thats awful, and a big price to pay for Washingtons disloyalty to the American worker. Thats what it was. It was disloyalty, stupidity, corruption, lots of reasons. But now you finally have a President who is loyal to you, and I am. Im a fighter for your jobs, for your wages, your factories, your families, and your dignity. Were stopping China from ripping us off. Were stopping all of these other countries from taking advantage of the United States where we lose our money, we lose our wealth, we lose our jobs, we close our factories. Thats not happening anymore. Its reversed. We were the sucker country for years and years, but we are not the sucker country anymore, and they all know it. Were replacing NAFTA  and that was a disaster, NAFTA  with the brand new US, Mexico, Canada agreement if Nancy Pelosi will ever put it up to a vote, which is questionable. Nervous Nancy, she doesnt want to give the people of our country a victory. Shes very busy doing other things. Having fun. The USMCA will be a massive victory for Mississippis farmers and also includes powerful protections for Mississippi auto workers, manufacturers, and everybody else. Its a great agreement. About time we got rid of NAFTA. The do-nothing Democrats need to stop their madness and pass the USMCA right now. The last administrations horrendous Trans-Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the US auto industry, but I proudly, first thing, withdrew from that job-killing calamity. Under our policies, Toyota has just announced a 170 million investment in Mississippi and 400 new jobs at its facility  did you ever hear of this place  Blue Springs. Blue Springs. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects all over the world. We take care of other people. We take care of other countries, but we dont take care of our own. They knowingly decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. They deployed our military to protect  think of this  immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. I ask those wealthy nations now, I respectfully the other day said to the King of Saudi Arabia, King, were going to help you, but youve got to pay. And he was great. No, he was great. He was great. He said, But nobody has ever asked before. I said, But Im asking. And billions of dollars will come in, and were protecting a great ally. We have a country that spends billions and billions of dollars in our country buying military and other things. But we said, Youre very wealthy. You have to pay, and theyre going to pay. And thats true with many countries by the way. Thats true with many countries. They never respected us. They could never believe it. I said to one country  I have great respect for the Prime Minister of Japan. I said to Prime Minister, I said, How did you get away with this for so long And he looked at me and he couldnt really answer it because how the hell did this happen Were protecting 94 countries. Ask China, How many countries are you protecting President Xi And they look at me like, What a stupid question. We protect one. China. You ask President Putin, How many countries are you protecting President Putin And he looks and he goes, Russia. You ask other countries  were protecting at least 94. In fact, so many they cant even tell me. Ive been trying to get an answer for four months. So many they cant even tell. Its crazy, but its all beautiful the way its happening. A lot of good things are happening. But these same politicians poured precious American blood and treasure into the sands of the Middle East while allowing our cities to fall into disrepair and decay. Our failed ruling class believed it was their right to rule over you, to take your money, to take your jobs, to redistribute your wealth all over the globe, wherever they wanted it. But I dont like that. I dont like that. The great sellout has ended, and it ended the day I took the oath of office. That was quite a day. After years of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation. We are finally putting America first. Our policy of never-ending war, regime change and nation-building is being replaced by the clear-eyed pursuit of American interests. It is the job of our military to protect our security, not to be the policemen of the world. Proving the wisdom of this approach, we recently secured a permanent ceasefire in Northern Syria without spilling one drop of American blood. Not one drop. Actually, I have to be honest. One soldier stepped on a nail. Thats true. I said, Dont tell the press that because theyll say, but one soldier stepped in a nail. I said, How bad was it Its okay. I said, Dont mention it please. They always like to mention exactly what happened. You can take it a little bit low key. Stepped on a nail. Not a drop of blood. And we dont have to defend the borders between Turkey and Syria. Theyve been fighting for 1000 years. But what we do is we did keep the oil, if you dont mind. We kept the oil. We kept the oil. And well distribute that oil, well help out the Kurds, and well help out other people. Well also help out ourselves if thats okay. Past leaders, foolish military adventures turned far away nations into very, very dangerous war zones. Then they demanded that American citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted nations and regions. I dont think so. I dont think so. We did not fight them over there only to invite them over here. We dont want to do that. To protect our communities, my administration restricted migration from terror-prone nations and implemented the toughest ever vetting procedures. Toughest ever that weve ever had. No issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party as that issue by the Democrats. They want open borders, which mean crime. They want sanctuary cities, which means crime and drugs and death. After bleeding the middle class dry, Democrats threw open our borders to the world, flooding our communities with poisonous drugs and criminal cartels. Republicans believe in strong borders and safe communities. We are now building a wall. Were building it. Were building it. And you think that was easy The Democrats, they didnt want that wall. I got money for everything, but when it came to the wall, not 25 cents. Not 25 cents. But we gave the military a lot of money and we took it from the military and we took it from here, we took it from there. Or we had to go to court and all of a sudden we start winning cases. Were winning cases now. Winning a lot of cases. But the wall is going up rapidly. Its going up rapidly. And this is a very serious wall. This is the exact everything they wanted. I went to the border patrol, incredible people and ICE. Incredible people, tough people. They love our country. And I said, Give me the specifications for the wall. They said, Well sir, wed like steel, but would also like concrete and would also like rebar. I said, Well, what do you want Which one So I did all three because its a different form of cutting. You can cut through steel, but you cant through the concrete and then you cant through the hardened rebar. We got it all. And we also need see-through, sir. Got to see whos on the other side. That makes sense, right Not just concrete. Its more expensive what were doing, but were giving and were building  we should have anywhere from 400 to almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year. Its going up fast. In all the right areas. In all the right areas. That was a tough one. And the Army Corps of Engineers is building their hearts out. Theyre great. Great people. We believe in keeping terrorists and criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country. And thanks to our tireless efforts on the Southern Border, tough place, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May, and we are faster than ever securing the Southern Border. And soon it will be, when the wall is completed, secure like its never been before. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. They right now have 27,000 soldiers on our borders. 27,000. You know what that is And they are keeping people out. And I want to thank the President of Mexico. Hes an excellent person, great man. And we appreciate it. And the reason is that our Democrats wont even approve things called loopholes. Theyre loopholes. Thats a horrible name, right That means its a loophole. That means you can come in illegally and lots of things. Catch and release. You catch them. Then youve got to release them. By law youve got to release them or theyll arrest the border patrol agent if they dont release. Its crazy. But we could end this in 15 minutes, but they dont want to do it. They dont want to do it. Theyre obstructionists. Theyre colluders. And we cant let it happen. Thats why you have to go with Tate Reeves. Tates going to send a big signal, by the way. Its a big signal. Its great for you. Hes going to be a great governor. It also sends a big signal to these radical left, crazy Democrats. Its very important that Tate wins. Very important. Were also fighting deadly sanctuary cities with the help of states like Mississippi, which has banned sanctuary cities because Phil Bryant said, Were not going to have them, and Roger Wicker said, Were not going to have them. And Cindy said, Were not going to have them. Democrats sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets. If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE  and they are heroes, I wouldnt want their job. MS-13, they walk right into those nests  they call them a nest  and they start swinging. You never saw anything like it. Ill say, You know what Better you than me. Lets see who would do good. Hed do good. That guy. That guy would do good. Most of you wouldnt do too good. No. I mean, these guys are tough guys and they love our country. Who would do it Theyre moving thousands of people from MS-13. These gangs are the worst people. These people, these are not human beings. You know, I said that once before and this crazy Nancy Pelosi said, How dare you say theyre not human You ever see these people And they slice people up with a knife because its more painful than using a gun. And then I have to defend myself when I say theyre animals. But you know what I never changed. I didnt say, Oh, Id like to apologize. Id like to apologize. Crazy Nancy. And you got to look at her district in San Francisco. Shes spending all her time on this crap or this impeachment stuff. Take a look at whats happening to the great city, once, of San Francisco. Its thousands and thousands of tents and drugs and needles and everything you can imagine floating in the streets in the best neighborhoods. Nancy Pelosi, go home and fix your district, Nancy. Go home and fix your district. Go home and fix your district. If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and border patrol, vote for Tate Reeves. Tuesday. Got to get out. You got to get out. Got to send the signal. Let it be a big victory too. The Democrat party has never been more extreme, you know that, than it is today. The Democrat healthcare agenda would obliterate Medicare. I will always protect Medicare for our seniors, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. Always. Well always take care of them. Virtually every Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb right up until the moment of birth. Well, the governor of Virginia executed a baby. Remember that whole thing. After birth, after birth. Some people never heard of it. He said the baby is born and then he starts talking to the mother. Nobody ever heard that. That is why Ive asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream. Nobody has done more for the African American community than the Republican party. And were also the party of Abraham Lincoln. We cant forget that. People forget. Abraham Lincoln. Honest Abe. To lift up distressed communities, we created opportunities zones. So incredible. So successful. Including 100 new opportunity zones right now in Mississippi where money is now flowing in to build and to fix. And Tim Scott, I give him so much credit from the great state of South Carolina choices. They can go out, get a doctor, we pay the bill, and they dont have to wait six weeks, four weeks, two weeks. We had people waiting in line. They werent very sick. By the time they saw the doctor, they were terminally ill. Now they go on and they go and they go outside and they find a doctor and we take care of our great veterans. The great rebuilding of the American Armed Forces has included massive investments in the military and facilities in Biloxi and Gulfport and Jackson and Starkville. And Roger has been fantastic. And Cindy Hyde-Smith has been fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To protect Americas security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. Its not the same country anymore. Nothings easy, but its not the same. And I recognized Israels true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. For years you watch as your politicians apologize for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Mississippi. The next step to victory begins on Tuesday right here in your great state. With your support we will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not ever going to back down from perhaps the greatest victory in political history. And you know today with the new stock market at an all-time high, its  I will tell you something  if we didnt win this election, that stock market would be in one-half. It was heading in the wrong direction. It was going to fail. And if they ever did anything bad, if they ever do anything bad to us, if they ever succeed in their wildest dream, which will never let them happen, that stock market will crash like youve never seen a crash before. And you will not be happy with your 401ks like youre happy right now because they dont know what theyre doing. They dont know what theyre doing. And Id like to speak well, but the leadership, they have no clue. Theyre just very vicious people. Actually, theyre sort of mentally violent people, but weve got it under control. It always helps when you didnt do anything wrong. I always say, How do you impeach a President who didnt do anything wrong So were going to send a signal by sending a terrific new Republican governor to Jackson. On Tuesday, youre going to get out and youre going to vote, and youre going to give up whatever you have to give up. Youre going to leave work maybe a little early or maybe get there a little late. Tell your boss I said it was okay. I will give you a pardon if I have to. Ill give you a one-hour pardon. But with your help, we will lift millions more of our great citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. And you have great congressmen here and Ill tell you, I want to appreciate it, fellas. Warriors, youre warriors. You are warriors. What was it 196 for and nothing against, right That doesnt happen with Republicans. It doesnt happen. I always complain. I always say the Democrats are lousy politicians. They have lousy policies. Open borders, sanctuary cities, but they have one thing. They stick together and theyre vicious. The Republicans have great policy. In many ways theyre better politicians, but theyre not as vicious. Thank you, darling. I appreciate it. Theyre not as vicious, but they have a tendency to split apart. The Democrats dont seem to have any Mitt Romneys. We do. We do. I dont know. Maybe hell get better. Maybe hell get better. Well see. Well see what happens. Maybe hell get better. Just let it be fair, but they dont have that. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, Made in the USA. Made in America. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. Can you believe that Within 10 years it will be over. When they told me that, I said, Thats incredible. Were going to end the AIDS epidemic within 10 years. Its funded. Nobody would have thought we could do that, but were doing it. Well have it ended in America in 10 years. The AIDS epidemic. Who wouldve thought We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto and we always will. Youll never see it disappear. In God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, pioneered technology, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And today its greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. Thats what were doing. Thats what happened in 2016. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Well get so tired of winning. I dont know, Mississippi. Youre winning. You had the best year youve ever had. You have the best, Mississippi, the best year youve ever had in the history of our country. Mississippi. Your statistic. Mississippi, arent you getting tired of winning I guess not. So Phil doesnt come to me and say, Sir, please, were willing too much. The people of Mississippi cant take it anymore. I dont think youll ever have to make that trip. I dont think hes ever going to have to, and I dont think Tate will ever have to make that trip. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Mississippi, the best is yet to come. Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Mississippi. Thank you."
NewHampshire,Aug15,2019," Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Wow. I will never, ever let you down, that I can tell you. Amazing. And I want to thank Manchester and New Hampshire, theyre very special. You remember those primaries That primary came around and remember what happened during the primary Trump should come in third or fourth, and we came in easily number one, and that was the beginning. That was an easy one. I want to thank you all. This is incredible and its great to be back in a state that I love with thousands of hardworking Patriots, who are the heart and soul of America. And thats what you are. Were actually here today to officially launch our campaign to win the great state of New Hampshire in 2020. And I saw some fake polls put out by the fake news media, and it said that Im tied with three of the other candidates, the Democrats, Im tied in New Hampshire. I dont think so. One of them has a rally, hes got 100 people. So this holds 12,000 were full. And we could fill it up four times at least. We could fill it up four times. But I just want to thank you all. I just think its going to be a tremendous four years. Were going to have a tremendous four years. Can you believe it We only have a little more than a year to go, where it all started, right The greatest political movement in the history of our country. And even though we had fake witch hunts on our back and all the other things that we had to go through, we have taken this big beautiful ship, and its being turned around very quickly. Three years ago, we campaigned across the country on a pledge to make America great again. And thats exactly what weve done. I think we can honestly say its the greatest slogan in the history of politics in America. Make America great again. So if you dont mind, the other candidates go, they spend millions and millions of dollars on this question that Im going to ask you. They spend millions. You remember the first slogan from our opponent Thats right, neither do I. Neither does anybody. Nobody remembers. The only thing I remember is the first night I went out after I heard it and I said, see, its all about her. And they immediately changed it after spending like a million dollars. Its all about her. That didnt work out too well. That slogan wasnt too good. So we have to do this. We have to make a decision. Do you give up the greatest slogan in the history of politics in our country Make America great again, right Do we give up make America great again for a new slogan, because look, our country is doing great. We are doing very well with China despite the fact that they want to have you believe in the contrary. All you have to do is say China, how you doing Theyre not too happy, theyre not too happy. Theyre losing millions of jobs. The tariffs are working, and theyre eating the tariffs by the way. Theres no price increase. You know, you gotta talk to these people. The fake news. But do we give up And by the way, the biggest beneficiary, you know who have been great Our great farmers have been so incredible because theyve been targeted by China, and frankly theyve been targeted for a long time, including by incompetent politicians that have run this country for a long time. So were making up for a lot of lost ground. But do we give up make America great for keep America great Keep America great. Okay, you ready Ready I love this because its free. And we have all the time in the world, right Is there anything better than a Trump rally What about a sleepy Joe Biden rally Well, hes made some beauties. I sort of hope its him. I dont mind any of them. You got Pocahontas is rising. We got Kamala. Kamala is falling. You got Beto. Beto is like gone. All right, well see what happens. Whoever it is, I dont know that it matters, but whoever it is different, different people. But I dont know, I think sleepy Joe may be able to limp across the finish line. But today they announced that theyre going to cut way back on his appearances because he is such a disaster, theyre going to have fewer appearances. Youve heard that, right Theyre going to cut way back on his appearances. Can you believe it If I ever did that, it would be over. The fake news would get us, but we dont let them get us and it is fake. And today the deputy editor of the New York times was demoted. Isnt that beautiful All the news that is not fit to print. All the news, the fake failing New York Times. Its really we, its not me. Were doing it together. They came from the Hills, they came from the mountains, from the rivers, they came from all over the place. And they showed up and they voted like nobodys seen before. And it was 306 to 223, remember 306. And we won Wisconsin and they said, Oh, we never thought of that. Got to think about those things. And we won Michigan. And now we have a lot of car companies coming into Michigan, and we have a lot of great farming events happening, really big in Wisconsin. And we have incredible things going on in Pennsylvania. We just opened up a 10 billion plant. We have many of them going up. Many of them, a lot of jobs. In Louisiana, an LNG plant 10 billion. Could never have happened, could never have happened. Pennsylvania would have never happened. They wouldnt have allowed him to frack. So they wouldve never been able to build it. But what a place that is, it will be open in a little more than a year, but I have to make a decision. Its a big decision. Do we give up the greatest theme, phrase, logo, whatever you want to call it, in the history of politics, risky, for a brand new one because make America great again. Were really sort of there, and we have a little time left. And now we have a group of socialists or communists, could be. Theyre not far away. The fake news will hit me on that. How dare he say that But theyre not far away, right Theyre not far away. 95%. Does anybody want to pay 95% taxes I dont think so. But Im not going to go into their plan because as far as Im concerned, the green new deal is a beautiful thing. No, its a beautiful thing. We want it to continue onward until about a month before the election. I will let them have it like youve never heard before. I dont want it to change. Too early. Its like Elizabeth Warren. I did the Pocahontas thing. I hit her really hard, and it looked like she was down and out, but that was too long ago. I shouldve waited. But dont worry. We will revive it. It can be revived. It can be rewritten, right It will be revived and it can be revived very easily and very quickly. And were going to have some fun in the state of New Hampshire. Now what do we do, ready Let me have first make America great again, then keep America great, right Just applaud like crazy for the one you want to use for this campaign. And theres a possibility well use both. Theres a possibility well use both cause I hate like hell to give up the one. Is it a possibility well use both Maybe one a little bit less. Are you ready So well start make America great again, and then keep America. Are you ready Whos in favor of the campaign theme being make America great again Whos in favor of our theme being keep America great Oh, wait a minute. This is your hat. I was going to keep it actually. Thank you. So thats really been the reaction. Ive done this before. Big crowds, and it really is keep America great because we have these socialists want to take it away from us. They want to take it away. Because until a couple of days ago, and thatll catch up very quickly, we have no choice. By the way, I never said China was going to be easy, but its not tough and they want to make a deal. We just spoke to them yesterday. They want to make a deal. They want to make a deal. They have to make a deal. And you know what Itd be wonderful to make a deal. I dont think were ready to make a deal. Were taking in billions of dollars in tariffs. And again, Chinas devaluing their currency. Theyre pouring out money, the prices havent gone up. So that means were taking in billions of dollars. Were not paying for it. And ultimately their devaluations are going to hurt them very badly. They want to make a deal, and they should want to make a deal. But when you listen to the fake news, look at how many there are. I mean, I actually had something today. I had something today. Are we sure that were in New Hampshire You know, you have a reputation. I mean, I know its not true cause I know you too well. You have a reputation of being very stayed, very, very elegant, stayed, incredible people. Youre not acting it tonight, and thats good. Thats a good thing. Wow. We love our country. We have enthusiasm for our country. Thats what it is. Before the election, our factories were closing. Hey, who knows it better than you Youre like central casting for the closing of factories. Our jobs were vanishing. Our military was totally depleted. When I took over, our military was sad. We werent flying half of our planes, they were old. They were tired. Our equipment was tired. Our people werent tired, though. Our people werent tired. But everything we had, it was depleted. Now weve rebuilt our military like never before. And all made in the USA, just so you know. And our nation was weakened at home and disrespected abroad. They dont disrespect us anymore, folks. I got NATO to pay an extra hundred billion dollars. They werent paying. They were delinquent. Many nations were, except for seven. Many nations werent paying what they were supposed to be paying, so were supposed to protect them. They kill us on trade. They have all sorts of barriers and everything else. The taxes are really unfair. The tariffs were ridiculous, what they do to us in Europe. And then we protect them. Then they dont pay, and I say, Im sorry folks, you have to pay. You have to pay. They were delinquent, they were delinquent. And my biggest fan is secretary General Stoltenberg from NATO. He said until president Trump came along, we were going, boom. They wouldve been finished very quickly, but Im tired of paying for other nations anyway, I have to be honest with you. Today, our nation is stronger than ever before. Were now stronger than ever before. You saw we ended the Iran disaster. How about that We paid them a 150 billion. 1.8 billion in cash. Cash, cash, cash. We got nothing. And they also want to make a deal. China wants to make a deal, and I will tell you Iran wants to make a deal because the sanctions are not good for them. They are not happy. So well see how it all turns out. But its in good hands. Its in good hands. The United States right now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Were rebuilding that awesome might that we were just talking about. Our United States armed forces. America is working again. America is winning again, and America is respected again, respected like never before. They respect us again, and you see it. You know, a recent poll came out where it showed that president Obama was more popular in Germany and other places than I am. And I said, of course hes more popular. Hes not demanding that they pay for their protection that we provide. Hes not doing that. Im doing that. And in fact, if I was the most popular, Im not doing my job right. So true. Weve created over six million new jobs since the election. If I would have said that during the campaign, those people back there would have been headlines, headlines. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Since my election, the number of new businesses starting in the great state of New Hampshire has skyrocketed by almost 25%. And you cant really go by my election. You gotta go by November 9th because the markets have gone through the roof since November 9th. Thats the day after I won the election. So I won the election. The markets went up thousands of points. Things started happening. You started doing things that you wouldve never. Even though I didnt get sworn in until January 20th, but they refused to do that. And let me tell you, if for some reason I wouldnt have won the election, these markets would have crashed. Thatll happen even more so in 2020. See the bottom line is I know you like me and this room is a love fest, I know that. But you have no choice but to vote for me because your 401ks down the tubes. Everythings going to be down the tubes, so whether you love me or hate me, you got to vote for me. I had a businessman the other day, one of the most successful guys in the country. Ive never liked him, never liked him. He never liked me, I never liked him. I see him in the white house. I said, What are you doing here He said, Im working to make sure you get elected. I said, Youve got to be kidding. You dont like me. I dont like you. What the hell is this all about He said, Thats right. Weve had our differences. I havent liked you, but to be honest with you, Mr. President, I have no choice. I said, Youre right. Youre right. First thing Ive ever heard him say that I agreed with, hes got no choice. He got no choice. Unemployment in New Hampshire has reached the lowest rate in actually 31 years. But within a very short period of time, it will be the lowest rate in the history of our country. Think of that. You have the best unemployment, you have the most successful state in the history of your state, and in the history of our country. And then youre going to vote for somebody else Oh, great. Lets vote for Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren. We have the best numbers weve ever had. Lets vote for somebody else. I dont think thats going to happen, folks. I dont think thats going to happen. Only with fixed poles does that happen Unemployment for African Americans. Youve heard me say this many times, and Im very proud of it. Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans have all reached their lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our county. Wages are rising quickly. Remember when I used to say people have been working two and three jobs making less money than they made 21 years ago I used to say it all the time. Now I can say for the first time in 20 years, wages are rising, and you know whos the biggest beneficiary Blue collar workers. My administration is fighting to expand opportunity for citizens of every background and every race, religion, color, and creed. Very important. Because we are all Americans. We all share the same home. We all share the same heart. We all share the same dreams. We are all children of the same Almighty God. But at the very moment when our country should be coming together to enjoy these wonderful blessings, the radical Democrats are trying to tear America apart. They vilify anyone who doesnt share their extreme views. They slander our law enforcement heroes. You see what theyre doing with our police that we love. You see what theyre doing. Has anyone ever seen anything like the water being thrown on New Yorks finest Have you ever seen And I know a lot of New Yorks finest. Theyre not happy, theyre not happy. And they are great people. These are great, great, proud people. For that to be allowed to happen is a disgrace. They view everybody as fascist and Nazis. They used the term Nazi. This was a term, you couldnt even use it. Now they use it like on a regular basis. Nazi. Hes a Nazi. Think of that. Hes a Nazi. You couldnt use it. Now they use it. They accuse our heroic border agents of running concentration camps, and they do an incredible job. And the Democrats dont want to fix the loopholes or asylum. They do an incredible job, our border agents. And they looked down upon the hardworking citizens who truly make our country run. But while the Democrats rage and resist  That guys got a serious weight problem. Go home, start exercising. Get him out of here please. You got a bigger problem than I do. Got a bigger problem than all of us. Now he goes home and his mom says, What the hell have you just done We are continuing our incredible movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country. Theres never been a movement like this. Never. Our movement is built on love, and it is, and we love our family. We love our faith. We love our flag, and we love our freedom, and thats what its about. And add to that the fact that we love our neighbors and we love our-  the fact that we love our neighbors and we love our country. Together we are all united by one fundamental principal. A nations first duty must always be to its own citizens, its own. Weve got to take care of our own. You havent heard that from a politician or a political leader in a long time. Its called America First. Its America First. Were thrilled to be joined tonight by many tremendous Republican leaders and great friends of mine, a man whos doing an incredible job as your governor, because I want to take 100% of the credit for the incredible turnaround of New Hampshire, and I remember it not so long ago, things were not looking good. People were leaving, a lot of bad things were happening, but we have to give him a lot of credit. Hes been a great governor, Chris Sununu, with a great father too, great father. With a great father His father was tough. Chris, your father was so tough. He was for somebody else in the primaries, and then one by one I won here, I won there, I won there. And then when I won his father got on and I said, Oh, this guy kills me. Hes so tough, and he said, President Trump will be the greatest of all time. I said, What happened What happened He went from being the toughest critic to the best there is. So I want to say hello to your father, okay Chris Youll tell him. Great guy. What a family. What a family. Thank you for Chris. New Hampshire Senate Republican leader, Chuck Morse. Chuck. Thanks, Chuck. New Hampshire House Republican leader, Dick Hinch. Thank you, Dick. Thank you, Dick. Great job. A man who was with me right from the beginning. In fact, he had a meeting at his house. His house has never been the same. His house is a disaster now. Like somebody said he just sold it. But you know what Because of the Trump economy, Ill bet he sold it for a big, big, fat, beautiful profit. Where is Steve Steve Stepanek and his wife, whos incredible. Did you make a lot of money on the house We destroyed the house. This was the beginning. He held some kind of a meeting for me, and he has a nice house, but literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people showed up and they destroyed his house. Its never been the same. No wonder you sold it. They finally gave up, and that was four years ago. Anyway, thank you very much both for being here. I appreciate it. What great people. Thank you, Steve. Great job. And I hope the buyer of his house didnt hear that little Steve. I hope the buyer didnt hear what I just said about your house. Hell cancel Thats all right. Youll sell it for more to somebody else, dont worry. Republican party chair, Ronna McDaniel. You know, Ronna headed up Michigan, and for many, many years nobody won Michigan as a Republican. But I used to complain, Id go there and Id say Theyre stealing your car business. Id go for years. In fact, five or six years before I even thought about running, for whatever reason, they named me Man of the Year in Michigan. I said, How come I didnt even understand it myself, but I was named Man of the Year. I wasnt even political. That was years before I did this. But I was always complaining that our car business is being stolen. I mean, its sort of obvious, right Mexico now has 32% of our car business. It all left the state of Michigan. We are bringing it back at a level that nobodys ever seen before, our car business. But I went to Michigan and my opponent was told that the Republicans, no way you can win Michigan, or Wisconsin, that you just cant. And we had a campaign manager named Ronna McDaniel, and Ronna wouldnt stop. Sir, can you be here next week I say, I dont know. Then I leave and she said, Sir, can you come back in three days I said, I dont know. Then I do it and she said, How about another time And then on election night she said, Sir, it was six oclock the day before the election. In other words, just a short while before the election. She calls me, Sir, can you be here tonight I said Tonight And by the way, you know where I was I was in New Hampshire. Thats right. She said, Sir, can you be here tonight I said, Are you sure I started speaking at one oclock in the morning. Now its election day. We had 32,000 people show up. It was like this. The crowd was just, they want to see things happen in our country. They love our country. It went crazy. I left and I said, I dont know why going to lose Michigan. Why would we lose Michigan Look at this. The opponent went there with Barack Obama and Michelle Obama and she went there much earlier. Prime time, one oclock, two oclock in the morning is not exactly prime time. We had 32,000 and they had a tiny little crowd, and I looked at my people and I said, I know were not supposed to win the great state of Michigan, but I think were going to win Michigan and we won Michigan and we won Wisconsin. We won Wisconsin. Wisconsin was a great victory, and we won Pennsylvania, and we won North Carolina and South Carolina, and we won Florida, and I hate to tell you we shouldve won New Hampshire. That was taken away. New Hampshire was taken away. It was taken away from us, but we shouldve. We did great in New Hampshire. We shouldve won New Hampshire, but thats okay. Im not holding it against you because it was not your fault. But we had a woman in Michigan and I said, When it came time to choosing the head of the Republican National Committee, I said, Who the hell is that woman up in Michigan that got me to keep coming there and explaining that we cant continue to lose our car business We have 17 companies now coming back in. Who is that woman And it was Ronna. We put her in charge of the Republican National Committee. The job that she has done is incredible. Thank you. The same with another man, our campaign manager. He started off as a computer genius, and remember when they used to say that the Hillary Clinton campaign is highly sophisticated, highly She did a lot of bad things folks. 33,000 emails deleted after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress, 33,000. Remember she said it was about her daughters wedding and yoga classes, 33,000, yes. it was disgraceful. I will tell you this, we now have a great attorney general. A fair guy, a great gentleman. Another man whos here tonight is the worlds tallest campaign manager. He is an unbelievable talent. But they were saying about our opponents Im not going to mention the name again because well never get it finished here, so Ill just say my opponent. Is that better They were saying how sophisticated her campaign was. Except ours was far more sophisticated, and we had a man that did an incredible job. Hes now our campaign manager and hes one of the tallest human beings Ive ever seen. His name is Brad Parscale and he is fantastic. Its nice when you dont have to look for anybody. You just look over and you see a guy whos twice as tall as everyone. Great job, Brad. Thank you. How we doing, Brad Good. Doing good. Got great poll numbers. Weve got great poll numbers in a lot of states, Ohio, Iowa. You know Iowa, every week that they campaign our numbers go up. Theyre winning Iowa. We gave them ethanol, which is very important. A lot of things for Iowa, but every week we seem to be going up in Iowa because theyre campaigning in Iowa. Wherever they go, our numbers go up. Somebodys going to have to explain that one to me someday, but we like it. A man whos a friend of mine who was the greatest mayor in the history of New York City. Stand up, Rudy. Stand up, Rudy. Rudy Giuliani. Man, he did a job in the first year. Ive never seen anything like it. New York was crime infested. We had problems. We had problems like nobody would believe. Rudy went in there and he did the job and people loved him for it. It wasnt like, Oh gee, hes a horrible person. People loved Rudy Giuliani. He was a great, great mayor. So thank you, Rudy, for being here. The first person that I put on on the campaign, he was driving me wild. He said, Im saying you can win, sir. You can win. Im telling you, you can win. He loves this state. Hes from this state. He said, You can win, sir. Im just telling you. I had him on for month after month. Hed come drive me crazy. Hed say, You can win, you can win, you can win. And finally we said, Lets give it a shot. And I had Corey, I had Hope, I had just a couple of people. We had a rather lean and mean staff. But Corey Lewandowski loves your state, loves New Hampshire. He was the first one that talked about us possibly winning the whole big ballgame. Hes tough and hes smart and Im hearing hes thinking about running for the Senate from New Hampshire. There we go. I think hed be tough to beat. Ill tell you one thing, hell go into Washington and hes going to have you in mind. Hes going to do a job if he does do it, so well see what happens. He hasnt made up his mind yet, but he would be fantastic. I guess its something you go back and you talk to your family, you talk to your wife and you make a decision. Theyre all saying, Are you going to support him I said, I dont know if hes running. So Corey, let us know please, if you dont mind. Let us know. Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker, pro jobs, pro family, pro growth, and 100% pro American. For decades and decades the permanent politicians in Washington pursued the very opposite. They sold out our workers. You see it. You know it better than any place. When I talk about the horrors of NAFTA, the horrors of trade deals I mean, Im sorry to tell you this, I usually refer to New Hampshire. Nobody took it worse than new England and nobody took it worse than New Hampshire. Now, heres the good news. I would never let that happen again and Chris will never let that happen again. Is there a doctor, please Doctor in the house Thank you. Doctor in the house. Please, doctor, please. Thank you very much. Take your time. Yeah, take your time. Thank you. Take your time, fellas. Plenty of time. You know, people got here two and a half days ago, many of these people in the front, right Two and a half days ago, a lot of these people, so you can understand. Its pretty tough. Thank you. Thank you. Thats okay. These are great people. These are great people that love our country, just remember that. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Pretty good. Pretty good. So our politicians shipped away our jobs, shed our sovereignty, surrendered our dignity, and saddled our nation in one foreign debacle after another, and were still here. He just said it. Were still here, you better believe it, and were here stronger than ever before were here. But all of that ended the day that I took the oath of office, the American people are in charge of their country again. We cut a record number of job-killing regulations that were strangling our country. We cut more regulations in two and a half years than any other president in their full terms. Four years, eight years, or in one case more than that, cut more than anybody. To get relief to working families we passed the largest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country. Youre making a lot more money. Youre making a lot more money and you see it and you know it because you see it in your paycheck every week. We ended the last administrations cruel war on American energy and we are delivering a policy of American energy independence like youve never seen before. In fact, if you look at the straits where were having all of the problems, you look at the straits, number one, theyre not touching our ships, theyre not playing with our ships. Theyre taking them from this country, from that country, from that country. But you know what Very importantly, we have very few ships going there anymore because we dont need that oil and gas. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. Every leading Democrat has pledged abolish the American oil, coal, and natural gas industries that are fueling our economic boom. Can you imagine this Were sitting on great wealth. They want to take it away from us, and the alternatives dont have the power. They dont have the power. They want wind, wind. Wind is oh so beautiful, as long as you dont have to stare at a windmill and your house goes down in value like to nothing. Steve, if you had a windmill anywhere near your house you wouldve gotten one third of the price you got, Steve. Thats true, by the way. Steves too smart to let that happen. We wont let them take it away from you. We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that shattered New Hampshire and your factories. They shattered your communities and they shattered American power and American prestige all around the globe. New Hampshire lost one in four manufacturing jobs following NAFTA and Chinas entrance into the Organization, two of the worst deals ever in the history of our world, not just our country. Election after election, politicians came to your state pretending to have the courage to stand up for the American worker, then they went to Washington and let other countries push them around, and special interests, buy them off and steal your jobs and take your companies. Thats what happened. Me, I dont care about their campaign contributions. It doesnt matter to me, folks. We want to do a job. We want to do a great job, and were setting records, and you know whos sending us the money The small donors. Well, we have big donors, but we have small donors are sending us the money for the election. Pretty amazing. Thats not supposed to happen to a Republican, but its happening to this Republican and its happening to you. Every vow that politicians made was broken, every hope was dashed, and every promise turned into a total betrayal of New Hampshire and of our country. But in this administration, we have something those sell-out politicians could only dream of. Its called strength and commitment. We dont play games. We dont play games. After years and years of building up other countries we are finally building up our country, standing up for our jobs, our workers, and standing up for our dignity. The forgotten men and women of America will never ever be forgotten again. You were forgotten. The last administration with sleepy Joe and Obama tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated, worse than NAFTA, worse than WTO. It was called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It would have been a disaster. TPP would have gutted the American auto industry. It would have been in shambles. Our auto industry is coming back so strong. It wouldve gutted, wouldve destroyed the industry. But in my first week in office I proudly withdrew the United States from that job-destroying catastrophe. Were imposing beautiful well-placed tariffs, money comes in, on foreign countries that cheat our workers, steal our jobs, and break all the rules, Im sorry. And by the way, theyve been changing and charging tariffs on us for years. We have countries that charge us 100%, 200%, 297% in the case of Canada with your farm products. Were not going to stand for it, and man, did we turn things around and weve just started. If companies dont want to pay a tariff, I have one simple solution. Come make your product in America. Come make your product in New Hampshire. Zero tariffs. Zero. No tariff. Together were restoring this nations industrial might and we are doing it with American iron, American aluminum, and American steel. Were doing it steel. Steel industry is high. They were dumping steel all over. They were destroying our companies. US steel now, all of them, theyre all expanding. the steel industry is back. Its doing great. Were opening up mines in Minnesota, the great state of Minnesota. They have magnificent mines that have the best iron ore in the world and President Obama closed them down. Maybe we can get Representative Omar from Minnesota to open it up, but I dont think so. Shell open them up. I dont think so. Representative Omar, thats another one. Were replacing NAFTA with the brand new USMCA. Thats Mexico and Canada. Great deal. The USMCA will create countless jobs for farmers and manufacturers all across the state. We need Congress to pass the USMCA immediately. Well make it a bipartisan deal. We dont even want credit. The unions benefit. The non-unions benefit. Everybody benefits. It brings it back to fairness and it makes it very hard for our companies to leave our countries, go to Mexico or Canada. We lose all our jobs. We lose all our taxes. We end up with empty factories and plants. It makes it almost impossible. Were not going to have that. That was my one rule that I had to have. Its going to be very, very hard for companies to do that. Ive also taken the toughest ever action to stand up to Chinas chronic trade abuses. Earlier this month, the US government officially labeled China for the first time ever a currency manipulator, another promise kept. While others allowed China to freely loot the US economy, 500 billion a year, not million, not million, billion with a B. Weve made it clear that the theft of American jobs and American wealth is over. Yet today, the Wall Street Journal editorial board and some others continue to publish foolish articles that demonstrate that they understand nothing about trade or business. Nothing. They advocate only economic surrender. They actually say, Go to China, take off the tariffs, make a deal. I lose all the cards we take off the tariffs. We dont have any cards. Think of it. They say Go to Europe.. By the way, the European union is worse than China, just smaller. It treats us horribly. Barriers, tariffs, taxes, and we let them come in. Its worse than China. Many of us come from there. I do. Thats what its got going. Thats about it. They treat us really badly, and many others, many, many others. India tariffs us probably higher than any nation anywhere in the world. We have tariffs of 100% on products and much more than that. India. So were working on all of them. I called Prime Minister Modi. I said, Mr. Prime Minister, its not fair. Weve got to change, weve got to change, weve got to change, and were talking to them very seriously. Were talking to a lot of places. But when the Wall Street Journal comes out and they say,  No, no, take the tariffs. Go and talk to China. Theyve been trying to talk to them for 25 years. But actually, you know what They really havent. The fact is the leaders that were in my position, they didnt do a damn thing. They didnt talk. They didnt talk. Past leaders followed the terrible advice of these editorial boards that are frankly totally inexperienced in business, I guess, and our industries were utterly decimated. Globalism enriches foreign countries at our expense. Globalism. I love our country. Im the President of the United States of America. Im not the president of the the world. As long as Im president, America will never bow to a foreign nation like we were for so many years. As we restore our prosperity, we are also restoring public safety. We are fighting to reduce violent crime. You see so much, and over the last 25 years so much crime, and ensure that every American can live in safety and peace. And yet with all that you see, weve had one of the best years of crime prevention that weve ever had. It wouldnt seem that way, but it is one of the best years because those gentlemen that we just saw, the law enforcement, they do a great job. Youve been reading about this a lot lately. We are working very hard to make sure we keep guns out of the hands of insane people and those who are mentally sick and shouldnt have guns. But people have to remember, however, that there is a mental illness problem that has to be dealt with. Its not the gun that pulls the trigger. Its the person holding the gun. Years ago, many cities and states, I remember it so well, closed mental institutions for budgetary reasons. They let those people out onto the street. You probably have your examples up here. I can tell you in New York they closed so many of them and they let really seriously mentally ill people out on the streets, and you see plenty of them today, even today. Were going to have to give major consideration to building new facilities for those in need. We have to do it. And at the same time, we will be taking mentally deranged and dangerous people off of  Mentally deranged and dangerous people off of the streets so we wont have to worry so much about that. The big problem. We dont have those institutions anymore and people cant get proper care. Theyre seriously ill people and theyre on the streets. We cant make it harder for good, solid law abiding citizens to protect themselves. We will always uphold the right to self defense and we will always uphold the second amendment. We will. So important. One of the most powerful promises I made to the people of this state was to confront the opioid and drug epidemic. I used to go around New Hampshire more than any state and youd say, Sir, the state is infested. You said, Sir, well like a drug den. You tell me. And I didnt really see it. And then I met with the police officers and fire departments and all the people that do. And you just seem to have a bigger problem. And by the way, the wall is being built. Thats- Thats going to stop a lot of it. The wall is being built. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Its being built. You know, we have the fake news. You know about that, where they  A wall thats lying on the ground in a very important section. So we pick up the wall, its in pieces. I mean literally its gone and we build a brand new 30 foot steel and concrete wall and the fake media said, He didnt build a wall. Thats just renovation. There was no wall, its lying on the ground. People walk right over and its rotted, rusted, gone. We take it away. We put a brand new wall up. They give me no credit. You know why Because theyre fake news. Thats why. Were building a lot of walls. The Army Corps of Engineers is doing a great job. Theyre doing a great job. Since I took office, weve attacked the challenge with everything we have. We have secured a record 6 billion in new funding. Opioid. We vastly increase the distribution of overdose reversing drugs, which are pretty amazing things. Weve given them to your police department, your fire department, pretty amazing. We have reduced the total amount of opioids prescribed by 34%. The department of justice has prosecuted more than 3000 defendants in opioids related cases. And our public awareness campaign about the terrible suffering that drugs inflict has already reached 58% of all young Americans. I said that you have to show them. Were doing ads beautiful ads. Shows them, and youve seen them. I dont even want to describe them. Theyre brutal. But were doing ads on television and papers about how bad it is for children so they can see it. Because the greatest thing we can do is not get people started on drugs, right. Not get them started. Its hard to get off. You know, we can get them off and were doing it and its been done. But its hard to get off. If they never start. Its real easy. Its real easy. So were trying to get young kids, you wont see the fruits of this labor for a little while because it takes a while. But were really, we are working so hard on advertising and promotions to tell young kids, children how bad drugs are, how dangerous they are, how horrible they are, how they destroy your brain, how they do so many bad things. And theyre really very tough ads. Theyre hard hitting ads. And I think theyre having a big impact. Youll see over time youll see. Over time youll see. But we still have much work to do. But as a result of these efforts, last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in 31 years. Thats pretty amazing. And at the center of Americas drug crisis is the border crisis. Vast quantities of deadly narcotics are being smuggled across the border including meth, cocaine, heroin and fentanyl. And as part of my trade deal with China, its been very important. And President Xi said hes going to do it. So far he has not done it. But I said, You have to stop sending us fentanyl. Have to. And you have to criminalize in China the making of fentanyl. And so far he has not come through, but I think he will. Youll know, youll know. Yet Democrats want to open borders and Republicans want strong borders. That youre difference. One wants open borders. Who can even think of an open border Think of it Even though many people that come into our country are wonderful people, theyre are still coming in illegally. Theyre not coming in through merit. But what about the bad ones We have serious, serious criminals that want to come in, and if we had open borders they would be flowing in like youve never seen before. Democrats want open borders, they dont mind crime. We do mind crime and thats the way it is. Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities. Last year alone sanctuary cities declined more than 17,000 requests from federal authorities to hand over criminal aliens already in their custody. In other words, 17,000 criminal aliens were released by these cities directly into US communities. You dont understand even what the hell are they doing What are they doing 17,000. Republicans believe our city should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. We will always support the amazing heroes of ICE and Border Patrol, and we will always support law enforcement. Every Democrat candidate also wants to give illegal immigrants free welfare. Republicans believe public benefits should be protected for truly needy Americans, not for illegal aliens. And we should reduce our taxes and many other things with all of that money that were talking about. We need to elect a strong Republican majority to end sanctuary cities. Stop human traffickers, stop drug smugglers and adopt an immigration system that puts the needs of American workers and families first. Its also time for Democrats to join with us to protect the sacred integrity of our elections by supporting voter ID, voter identification. Its incredible. Theyre constantly saying, Oh, we need to protect them. But theyre not looking for that. Theyre not looking for that. We say, What about voter ID In other words, you have a picture, you have to go up. What about voter ID That they dont want to do, but we need voter ID. The Democrat party has never been farther outside the mainstream. Where do they come from You know, you say you want low taxes, good education, strong military, strong borders. You want to have safe homes. You want a house, you want low interest rates, youve got low  Hey, you got low interest rates. The lowest ever. Got low rates, its a good time to refinance your house, by the way. Great time. You got everything, and then you see these people theyre against  They have no idea what theyre doing. They have no idea what theyre against. Every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would raid Medicare and destroy the private health insurance plans of millions of American families that they love. My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you. The individual mandate is gone. The most unpopular part of Obamacare, and we almost have Obamacare gone. Were close. We would have had it before, but we had a vote that was a little bit surprising. Im sure none of you knew who that vote was. We had it done, repealed and replaced. But its going to happen and I think its going to actually be in the end, actually better. You watch. So we got rid of the individual mandate, which was the most unpopular part of Obamacare. And were running it better. You know, I had a political decision. Do I make it great Alex Azar our secretary, do rerun it well and sort of say, Hey, we run it well. Or do we run it badly and have everybody upset We said, we got to run it well, but its still much too expensive. Its lousy healthcare. But we got rid of the worst part of it. Individual mandate, individual mandate, where you have the privilege of buying the right not to have to pay for expensive insurance. thats no good health insurance. And we wont  And you got to remember this. Republicans, and I speak for every one of them, we will always protect pre-existing conditions. Were going to protect, always. Right, got to do it. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in 51 years. The only decline in 51 years. We have launched a historic initiative to require price transparency, empowering you to choose the lowest price for yourself and for your family. Believe it or not, you didnt have the right to go in and price your drugs. Who could even believe this I wonder if big pharma had something to do with that. So were going to have transparency. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb. Right up, up till  Right up until the moment of birth. And in the case of the Virginia governor, hes having a rough, rough time. In his case, the baby is born, and then he goes to talk to the mother. The doctor talks to the mother. The baby is now born, wrapped as he said, and then they decide whether or not to execute the baby. Who would believe that. That is why Ive asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred, the gift of God. Hard to believe isnt that. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion and socialism. The Republican party is the party of freedom. We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream and Im fighting for you each and every day. So importantly we have confirmed more than 140 federal judges. Within 90 days it will be 179 federal judges. Thank you very much President Obama. Thank you very much. I dont know what happened to them, but I came to office and I had 138 judges that were not appointed by President Obama. So I say, thank you Mr. President, very good and theyll say he was a great president. Oh, the fake news. He was a great president. If he was a great president how come he left me 138 judges to appoint when everybody says thats the single most important thing a president of the United States has to do. Great president. He was great. He was a great president. And these judges will apply the law as written, including we appointed two great Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. And to help patients with life threatening illnesses we also pass something Im so proud of, 44 years they couldnt get it passed, right to try. You can use our newest, our best medicines. Incredible. Whats happening. Im so proud of that. And this from forever, five decades. We pass for our great veterans VA choice and VA accountability. And one of our great friends was a veteran whos been with me in New Hampshire. I dont know where you are. Wheres our guy Where is he So, Al. So, I walk in I said, hello. Hes been with me from the beginning. He wasnt with  He liked Trump. And I came in. He said, sir, hes a great veteran. He said, Sir, I have cancer. And sir, I went into the vet. They were very, very late. They had problems. Im not blaming them, but they gave me the right to go out and get a great cancer surgeon. He had his operation. You look much better than you did three years ago Al, much better. Much better. VA choice, right Al. VA choice. Great story. Thank you very much, and thank you for your loyalty. Hes been to every rally I ever gave a New Hampshire right from the beginning. I got so tired of looking at him. Hed always be here. Now hes  Look at him, now hes sitting in very good. Thats good. But I appreciate that story. I appreciate. VA choice just makes sense, right Doesnt it make sense Weve achieved record funding for the United States military. 716 billion, 700 billion and 738 billion. And its almost completely rebuilt. Including, and we hope to God we never have do use it. We have the finest, most powerful nuclear capability anywhere on the face of the earth. And I hope to God we never have to use it. Were investing in the future of human space flight. And someday soon American astronauts will plant the stars and stripes on the surface of Mars. I told my guys at NASA, you know, NASA, when we took it over, it was exhausted. The runways and the grounds had all weeds growing through the cracks in the concrete. You wouldnt recognize it now. Its beautiful. Its the best place anywhere on earth. And I also said, though, you know, I hear all these rich guys for some reason, they love space. So theyre rich. I said, let them send the rockets up. What the hell do we have to do it Right So I see Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, theyre putting rockets up. I think its great. And they pay us rent. They use our facility. Thats great. But were also doing it, and NASA has some of the greatest plans weve ever had. These are great people, great scientists. But we also let the private sector put up rockets. The one which recently went up and you see the engines coming back down and they coming  Theres no wings, no nothing. Its almost like, what are we watching is this fiction And they come down and they save all of the propellants. All of the, really the most expensive parts. Theyre able to save it by bringing it back right to where it took off. Who would think they could do this I never saw this before six months ago, but theyre doing it now more and more. Theyre saving a lot of the most important and expensive parts of rockets. So we have a lot of rich guys paying us a lot of rent. But were also doing it ourselves. To protect Americas security. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. I recognized Israels true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And just three months ago, we also recognized the Golan Heights as being a part of and protected by Israel. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of New Hampshire. Thank you. And you must never forget the 2020 election right around the corner. 2020 right around the corner. And its about one thing. You know what the one thing is, you. Its about you. Its about your family. Its about your future. And its about the fate of your country. So when we ran together last time, we said the most importantly we had to turn it around. This country was going bad. You see what happened to Venezuela with socialism Venezuela 15 years ago was one of the richest countries. Now they dont have water, they dont have food, they dont have anything. And this was one of the richest nations in the world. They dont have anything. Were working on it. Were helping people, but its very sad. Its never going to happen to us because we will never ever be a socialist nation. Ever. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction  The destruction of the American dream. We have a dream. Its a great dream. This the destruction of the American dream. We begin this campaign tonight with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for the people of New Hampshire and for the people of America. Together we will lift millions more citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Millions and millions of people. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that are already happening that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, ending the AIDS epidemic in America and finding new cures for childhood cancer. Something I never thought Id be able to say, within one decade the AIDS epidemic in the United States will be gone. Think of that. Did you ever think you were going to hear that No. Did you ever think you were going to hear that The work theyve done on AIDs is incredible. Thats an incredible thing. When they told me that, its just shattering. It just, it breaks your heart whats happened. But think of it in 10 years, the AIDS epidemic will be eradicated. So great. Who thought that was going to be happening. Who thought Id be able to get to say that so early in what were doing together. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious Liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together. There is one America we will support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. Well stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. Through every day and every challenge our hearts speak to the words of the New Hampshire state motto, live free or die. We are fighting for every American mom and dad who wants to protect this land of Liberty for their precious, beautiful children. We are fighting for every young boy and girl who deserves to grow up in a nation of builders and dreamers, pioneers and patriots, and we are fighting for every citizen of the greatest Republic on the face of this earth. Every day my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The brave this beautiful, strong, proud, and free future. It belongs to us. Its up to us. We control our own destiny. And with your help, your devotion and your drive. We are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one great movement. One people, one family and one glorious nation under God. And together we are making America wealthy again. We are making America strong again. We are making America safe again. And we are making America great again. Thank you. New Hampshire. Thank you. Thank you."
Charleston,Feb28,2020,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All I can say is that the fake news just doesnt get it, do they They dont get it. They just dont get it. Hello Charleston, and Im thrilled to be back in the great state of South Carolina with thousands of hardworking American Patriots who believe in faith, family, God, and country. Thank you. Its a phenomenal crowd, only topped by the number of people outside that didnt get in. If anybody would like to give up where youre standing or your seat, please raise your hand. All right. Then lets begin, right Thank you all very much though. This is great. No, they dont get it. Down the road, they have a rally for one of the people that are going to be running tomorrow. Theyre trying to get to a hundred, but theyre not going to make it. So I think theyre going to set up a round table. Well, thats what they do. So people want to go to a rally, they end up sitting at a round table talking about their definition of impeachment. Crazy. No, its crazy. Crazy Its a crazy deal. No, the fake news media, theyve been trying to figure this out for years. They still dont get it though. They dont get it. Look at all of those cameras. Look at all of those cameras. Thats a lot of cameras. Thats a lot of cameras, Lindsey and Tim, thats a lot of They heard you guys were here. They heard Tim was here and that Lindsey was here and that And they said, Were not going to attend that rally, but when we heard those two guys plus our great congressmen, theyre here, great congressmen. But this is an incredible time for our nation. Were thrilled to be in the midst of what we call the Great American Comeback and thats what it is. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, factories are returning, poverty is plummeting, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military. Our country is stronger than ever before. We are stronger, we are better, but while we are building a great future, the radical left Democrats in Washington are trying to burn it all down. They have spent the last three years, and I can even go further than that, three years since the election, but we go before the election, working to erase your ballots and overthrow our democracy. But with your help, we have exposed the far lefts corruption and defeated their sinister schemes and lets see what happens in the coming months. Lets watch. Lets just watch. Very dishonest people. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right Coronavirus, theyre politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, Hows President Trump doing They go, Oh, not good, not good. They have no clue. They dont have any clue. They cant even count their votes in Iowa. They cant even count. No, they cant. They cant count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didnt work out too well. They couldnt do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. Theyd been doing it since you got in. Its all turning. They lost. Its all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But we did something thats been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early. We went early, we could have had a lot more than that. Were doing great. Our country is doing so great. We are so unified. We are so unified. The Republican party has never ever been unified like it is now. There has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now. Never been a movement. So a statistic that we want to talk about, go ahead. Say USA. Its okay. USA. So a number that nobody heard of, that I heard of recently and I was shocked to hear it, 35,000 people on average die each year from the flu. Did anyone know that 35,000, thats a lot of people. It could go to 100,000, it could be 27,000. They say usually a minimum of 27, goes up to 100,000 people a year die. And so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States. Nobody. And it doesnt mean we wont and we are totally prepared. It doesnt mean we wont, but think of it. You hear 35 and 40,000 people and weve lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode. CNN fake news and the camera just went off, the camera. The camera just went off. Turn it back on. Hey, by the way, hold it. Look at this, and honestly, all events are like this. Its about us. Its all about us. I wish theyd take the camera, show the arena please. They never do. They never do. They never do it. They never show the arena. You can hear it because when you hear it, thats not 200 people. Thats not a hundred people. Thats thousands and thousands of people including people outside. You can hear it. They always show my face. See that face They show my face. I want them to show the arena, not my face, right How many have you been to How many rallies have you gone Practically every one. Can you believe it Im sure your husbands are thrilled, right Theyre thrilled. Where are you going tonight Im going to another Trump rally. Cool. Number 114. What do your husbands say about that This group up here. She said, We dont care. Thank you. Thank you. Democrats will only say horrible things even though they know were doing a great job. Were doing a great job with what we have to work with. Its incredible. The Democrats want us to fail so badly. Even if their actions, and you take a look, hurt the people of this country, theyll hurt the people themselves, their wealth, their everything. Theyre willing to hurt our country in order to say bad, even if they know its not so. We made an unbelievable deal with Mexico, with Canada, with China, with South Korea, with Japan. And if you put a microphone with these people back there like the Academy Awards used to be, not anymore. Best movie of the year. Its made in South Korea. Whats that all about Im waiting to see the best movie of the year- And its made He said, Its garbage. Only in South Carolina can you say that. Only in South Carolina. Youre going to get us in trouble. No, Im just repeating what he said for the fake news. No, but seriously the Academy Awards has gone way, way down in ratings. Do you know why Because they started attacking us and we dont believe in it anymore. Thats why. No, but they had the best movie of the year made in South Korea. They make enough stuff for us, right And theyre good. Theyre our friends. Take advantage of us, thats okay. Not so much anymore. We are really, you take a look, magnificently organized with the best professionals in the world. Were prepared for the absolute worst. You have to be prepared for the worst, but hopefully it will all amount to very little. Thats why I tell you when we have the flu with 35,000 people and this one we have to take it very, very seriously. Thats what were doing. We are preparing for the worst. My administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States. We are ready. We are ready. Totally ready. On January 31st, I ordered the suspension of foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering the United States. An action which the Democrats loudly criticized and protested and now everybodys complimenting me saying, Thank you very much. You were 100% correct. Couldve been a whole different story. But I say, so lets get this right. A virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesnt spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes, and the Democrats single talking point, and you see it, is that its Donald Trumps fault, right Its Donald Trumps fault. No, just things that happened. But you know what this does show you Things happen. Whoever thought of this two weeks ago Who wouldve thought this could be going on four weeks ago You wouldnt. But things happen in life and you have to be prepared and you have to be flexible and you have to be able to go out and get it. And my guys that we have the best professionals in the world, the best in the world and we are so ready. At the same time that I initiated the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. We had a quarantine some people. They werent happy, they werent happy about it. I want to tell you there are a lot of people that not so happy, but after two weeks they got happy. You know who got happy The people around them got happy. Thats who got happy. I also created a White House virus task force. Its a big thing, a virus task force. I requested 2.5 billion dollars to ensure we have the resources we need. The Democrats said, Thats terrible. Hes doing the wrong thing. He needs eight and a half billion, not two and a half. Ive never had that before. I ask for two and a half, they want to give me eight and a half, so I said, Ill take it. Does that make me a bad Ill take it. Ill take it. I never had that before. I never had it. We want two and a half million. Thats plenty. We demand you take eight and a half. He doesnt know what hes doing. We want eight and a half. These people are crazy. We must understand that border security is also health security. And youve all seen the wall has gone up like magic. Its gone up like magic. You think that was an easy one That was not an easy one. Its going up great and were up now 132 miles and this is the exact wall that border security, water, everything. This is everything they wanted, 132 miles already. Well have 500 miles built by very early next year sometime. One of the reasons the numbers are so good. We will do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country. We have no choice. Whether its the virus that were talking about or many other public health threats, the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans. Now you see it with the coronavirus, you see it. You see it with the coronavirus. You see that. When you have this virus or any other virus or any other problem coming in, its not the only thing that comes in through the border. And were setting records now at the border. Were setting records. And now just using this, so important, right So important. Im doing well in the polls despite the worst fake news and worst presidential harassment in the history of the United States. Weve got phenomenal numbers. No, its true. The worst presidential harassment in history. We had a great event yesterday, an event that was so beautiful, young African American leaders. One of the things I asked them, and Ive been thinking about this for a long time And great people, great people. Some of them are here tonight. Do you like the name African American or Black And they said, Black all at the same time. No, true. I tell you. Because you say, African American or Black And they said almost immediately, Black. But we had an incredible group of people and what happened is NBC It was such a love fest. It was so incredible. It went on for 45 minutes. It was a love fest. It was incredible. NBC turned down There they are right there. They turned down Comcast, which owns NBC Actually NBC, I think, we call it MSDNC, right MSDNC. But NBC I think is worse than CNN. I actually do. And Comcast, a company that spends millions and millions of dollars on their image Ill do everything possible to destroy their image because they are terrible. They are terrible. Theyre a terrible group of people. And they paid me a fortune for years for the Apprentice. They paid me a fortune. And when I left the show, it was doing great. When I left the show, 14 seasons, think of that, they got a big movie star. I wont tell you his name. Nobody would know. Actually nobody will know his name because he was on for such a short period of time. But the show went down the tubes very quickly after they had Trump. But the country in five years from now, of course you want to upset them, five years or nine years or 13 years. Or 18 years 10 more years. Nah. Oh, they go crazy when you say it. When you say to them five more years, so its five, but you then say maybe nine, maybe 13, maybe 17, maybe 21, or not, maybe 21. Lets do this. Lets term limit ourselves at 25 years. No more than 25 years. No more. Okay. Theyll pass something in the Senate. Tim, pass it in the Senate with Lindsey, a 25 year term limit please. 07. While the extreme left has been wasting Americas time with these vile hoaxes, weve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border, and lifting up citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. We added another 225,000 jobs last month alone. And that makes seven million jobs since our election, seven million. The unemployment rate in the great state of South Carolina. You ever hear of that place Now Sleepy Joe would say, The unemployment rate in the great state of Ohio No, no. Youre in South Carolina. Joe Joe, youre in South Carolina. Come up. You ever see the guy with the note, No, no, its South Carolina Its not Ohio. Okay. Then he goes, All right, Iowa. Did you say Iowa No. No. They did that seven times. If I did that once, it would be the end of the road, right Be the end of the road. Theyd say Trump has lost it. They like to say that anyway, I guess though. These people are bad people. Now, Sleepy Joe. Well, hes running tomorrow. No, but could you imagine if I said just a small fraction of the mistakes he makes, which are unbelievable Every speech. I actually said the other night, I was watching him when he said about half the population wiped out with guns. I said, Thats a horrible thing. Thats the end of his evening. Thats the end of his political career. And then after the debate, theyre revealing him and they said, Joe Biden had a great night last night. I dont get it, Tim. The unemployment rate here in South Carolina has fallen to 2.3%, the lowest rate in your states history. The lowest rate in all of America. Its the lowest rate in all of America. I said to a friend of mine, a Democrat, Hows the race going tomorrow Whos going to win And he says, Mr. President No, its very interesting. He said something. This guys a real political pro too, in all fairness, even though hes a Democrat. But I said, Whos going to win He said, Honestly, sir, it doesnt matter. You are so far ahead in South Carolina that its meaningless. Meaningless. Thats what they say. And in North Carolina too. In North Carolina, bunch of losers. The good citizens of South Carolina have had a front row seat to the extremism of the Democrat candidates. Whether its this character that nobody ever heard of him. Id never heard it. I thought I knew all the wealthy people. This guy Tom, Mr. Impeachment, how did that work out, Tom Hey, he spent millions and millions of dollars in Iowa, right Millions. He got less than 1%. He got one third of 1%. I wrote a little note. Did you see it It said, Tom, its not so easy doing what I did. Is it Not so easy. Not so easy. All you have to do is ask Mini Mike. Hes in there for a fortune. He wished he never started. Mini Mike, he wished he never started. He said, Well, Trump can do it. Im going to do it too. Unfortunately its not working out too well. Was that the worst debate performance in history They had a big audience. Everybody wanted to see whether or not he was good at what were supposed to be doing up here. He turned out to be a total catastrophe. 35 million people, can you believe that Thats a big audience. Very big. And what a killer. But this guy Steyer, he spends all this money. Hes not that wealthy. He spends all of this money and you shouldnt waste your vote on him tomorrow. I have to be honest. By the way, are the Republicans allowed to vote anyway even though Are you ready You ready Lets do it together. I assume this is okay from a campaign finance standpoint, I assume. Lindsey, Tim, our great congressmen, are we allowed to do this So am I allowed to request First we- Congressman, are we allowed to do this Am I allowed to request  First, we have to figure out who would be the weakest candidate against President Trump. And then if its legal, I always say if its permissible by law, because they have so many little booby traps, but they only like getting the Republicans. Democrats skirt, right But well see what happens about that. The Democrats. But let me ask you this. Lindsey, Tim, youre pros. These are two of the greatest guys I know. So let me ask you this. So I dont know what the record attendance is in this arena, but I was told that we broke it by a lot. And you got the people outside. Are we allowed to tell them who we would like them to vote for Because youre allowed to skip. All right, so wait a minute, lets do a poll. We do this for the fake news back there. Ready Who would be the best candidate for us Not for them. Were ready. Ready So lets go through them just quickly. We wont include Steyer because hes a loser. Hes out, okay We wont include him. Who would be the best This is a real poll. This isnt one of those fake polls taken by  In all fairness, I love you, Fox, taken by Fox, the worst pollster. This guy  this pollster hates Trumps guts. I was losing the last election by a fortune. They said, He did great with women. Everything was wrong. And they never replaced this guy. But watch this. You ready So first well go  lets say sleepy Joe, right Right Then well go crazy Bernie. Then well go mini Mike. I think hes out of it. Should we include mini Mike or not Mini Mike is gone. Mini Mike is gone. I think hes gone. He doesnt have a chance. So lets not talk  and hes not in your election anyways, so lets forget. So mini Mike, I hear mini Mike, by the way, has left. Hes basically given up. Thats what I hear. He gave up. He gave up. Now, I hope what I just said keeps him in. You know, hes the kind of a guy, hell stay in because, I dont want to be wrong. Mike, its time to go home. Go home, Mike, and enjoy your life. Go home and spend some money on something horrible to people. They said, Shes not dumb, but shes just damn mean. We cant vote for her. Shes a mean one. She is mean. So Pocahontas, should we leave her in or out How about Klobuchar Not going to happen. So really were down to two candidates, right Sleepy Joe Biden and crazy Bernie. So this is a poll. I guarantee you this. As much as they hate me, they hate me. Theyre going to put this all over the place. We have a poll of like 30,000 people inside and out. Theyre doing it outside, too. We have a poll. Are you ready Who do I  So in other words, whos the weaker of the two Im not interested in who does better. No, no. Im not interested  wait. Ready In other words, who do I want to run against Meaning  very simple. We put it into nice, simple language. Who the hell is easier to beat So who is easier for us Not me. For us to beat. Ready Crazy Bernie Or sleepy Joe I dont know. I think maybe a crazy Bernie has it a little bit. Once more just quick. Ready He said, It doesnt matter, youll beat them all. I hope so. I hope so. So who is easier to beat, crazy Bernie or sleepy Joe They think Bernies easier to beat. They think Bernies easier to beat. So whether its Bernie Sanders plan to eliminate private healthcare, Elizabeth Warrens plan. I told you that I had more Indian blood in me than her, even though I have none. I have none. Zero. I have none. I have none. I said I have more Indian blood in me than she has. And she choked. She said, Im going to show. Im going to show. She hired this company and they went out and did a blood test. 1,024th, right So that means I probably one somewhere down the line a million years ago. Im telling you, that was horrible. She choked. We dont want a person to win that chokes. We dont want to choke artist, right One thing you will say about me, Im not a choker. With all these people for years, theyre after me years. We cant have chokers. We cant have chokers as your president. So Elizabeth Warrens plan to eliminate Americas borders. Thats what she would  or mini Mikes plan to eliminate your Second Amendment and take away your guns. How about that Mini Mike wants to take away your guns. The insanity of the Democrat party is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great new Republican party. This November, we are going to take back the House. We are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. I wonder what they say when they go down the road and they see these groups of 200 people. Seriously. I wonder what they say. They never talk about it. Theyll say, Joe Biden had a fabulous crowd today. Fabulous. So fabulous that theres like five people. And theyll leave and theyll say, President Trump had a smattering of applause. Smattering. They use the word smattering a lot. This is not  lets let them hear it. This is not a  this is a big  this is not a smattering. Its not a smattering. Turn the cameras. Thats not a smattering. That is not a smattering. I hate it. They say Donald Trump  In India, I hate to say this to you, but  so they actually have 129,000 seat stadium. Did you see it The place was packed, and they did better than most. They gave me credit for 100,000. That was not bad. Its 129. The stadium holds 100. They had a field thats about three times  its cricket. Its the biggest stadium. And they had 129. I was with the Prime Minister of India, Modi. Great guy, loved by the people of India. And we had an amazing thing. And I went in, and heres the problem. This is a big crowd. And normally I like talking about my crowds because I get the crowds like nobody, but I just got back from 140 or 50 or 60,000 people and now Im coming here. What does this place hold, 15 Its hard to be enthused. You understand that I may never be excited again about a crowd after going to India. Think of this, they have 1.5 billion people. We have 350, so were doing pretty well, Ill tell you what, but I love this crowd, and I love that crowd too. Tell you they have a great love for  They have a great love. They have a great leader, and they have a great love for the people of this country. That was really a worthwhile trip. With us tonight are both of your incredible US Senators. Two incredible friends, two warriors. Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott, come up here. And by the way, Tims incredible mother is right here in the front row. As theyre doing that, they got this big  I was going to almost do a poll on the two of them, but were not doing that. But Lindsey is a true fighter for South Carolina. Loves your state. And as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  you know that, right Hes the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. So important. So important. Senator Graham has been leading the charge to help us confirm a record number of judges to uphold the Constitution as written. Lindsey was amazing, you remember, for Justice Brett Kavanaugh Remember how badly he  Great job, Lindsey. Great job, man. Thank you. Senator Scott is a leading superstar. Hes a superstar. But he is a leader in lowering healthcare costs like nobody has done it. People dont know, but in the last year, prescription drug prices came down for the first time in 51 years. And that was with no Democrat help. If we had the help, we could lower it by 50%. But well get their help. One of these days, theyre going to get smart. Senator Scott provides world class care for our veterans. What hes done for our veterans is incredible. And bringing investment to distressed communities across our country through opportunity zones, including 135 right here in South Carolina. Thats what it is. Tim Scott came to my office with an idea. He said, Opportunity zone. I said, Tim, what the hell is that What is it Right, Tim And he went through a whole big thing and I said, This maybe could work, and we tried it. It is an incredible success, and what hes done for this country is incredible. Its incredible. Lindsey. Well start with Lindsey. Say a few words, please. Thank you. Well, that was quite a display, wasnt it Now theres a lot of love in this room. A lot of people say to me, friends of mine, theyve very successful. Theyll say, How do you speak in front of 25,000 people and 10,000 people and all of this You know why Theres such love in the room its easy. No, its true. There is such  I explained, they dont understand it, because theyre not for doing that, but I say there is such unbelievable love in the room that its easy to do. Very easy. Right Its sort of easy to do. Were also thrilled to be joined by many more great leaders from across the state. And some of you maybe know I liked this guy for a long time, Governor Henry McMaster. Come up, Henry. Come up, Henry. Representatives Joe Wilson, Jeff Duncan, William Timmons, Ralph Norman, Tom Rice, and the Chairman of the South Carolina Republican party, Drew McKissick. As I introduce somebody, and Ill just say stay there because he was brave, but he got hit hard. Hes a very special man, retired Marine Corps, major general, and most of you know he received the Congressional Medal of Honor, James E. Livingston. James, just relax. Wheres James He got hit hard. Thank you, James. Congressional Medal of Honor winner. Thank you, James. They are great brave people. You know, we have the Congressional Medal of Honor and we have the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and theyre both the highest awards. One civilian, one is military. I always say getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom is much less painful because when I read them off, Ill read like with James or with so many of the Congressional Medal of Honors, many are not living, to be honest with you. And Ill read stories where one of them recently going up a hill, hit 19 times by gunfire, grabbing four people, bringing them down, getting onto a helicopter, falling out of the helicopter, hitting a tree on the way down. Hitting a tree. They went back and saved him, but he died later. I mean, those are tough deals. Those are tough deals. We have one right here whos living. We have one right here whos living. But they are tough. So thank you very much for being here. And maybe I could ask our governor, our great governor of this incredible state, to say a few words. Please, Henry. Thank you very much. And wheres Alan Is your son here Youre great son, Attorney General Alan, thank you very much. Take good care of him, okay Thank you. Thank you, Alan. And thanks to Republicans all over America. We are now working on things that nobody ever thought possible. Since my election, over 121,000 new jobs have been created right here in South Carolina. Weve lifted 10 million people off welfare, including 7 million off of food stamps. And thats a good thing, not a bad thing. Theyre working and they have great jobs and they love getting up in the morning and theyre making much more money and it costs our country nothing. We make money, they pay taxes. Its a whole different deal. Median household income has reached the highest level in the history of our country. The unemployment rate nationwide has hit the lowest rate in over 50 years. The average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history. How about that one Its a good one. Thats a good one. The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has reached record lows. Black youth unemployment has reached an all time low. Black poverty levels are the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country.  Paid family leave. Reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million American families an average of 2,200 more in their pocket thanks to the Republican Child Tax Credit. Republican, not Democrat. We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that decimated manufacturing all across your state and all across our country. For years, politicians sold you out to global special interests, enriching other countries at your expense. That ended. That ended. But I am not the president of the globe. I dont want to be the president of the world. I am the president of the United States of America.  reciprocal. Reciprocal. Got to be fair. After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. We are finally putting America first. On no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than the issue of immigration. Every Democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens funded by you, the American taxpayer. They want to treat illegal aliens, people that come into our country illegally, better than they want to treat our military and our veterans. Not only does illegal immigration drain our treasury, but it threatens innocent lives. I recently invited to the White House the granddaughter of a 92 year old woman who was raped, beaten, brutalized, and murdered by an illegal alien who had previously been set free in New York City. Here in Charleston County, an illegal alien was recently charged with sexually assaulting a young girl in the fourth grade. In Berkeley County, officers captured a previously deported MS-13 gang member who shot a man to death before dousing the body in gasoline and setting him on fire. And he should have never been in our country. He shouldnt have been allowed. Its being built. Its being built. By the way, just in case you havent heard, it is being built. That, you know. And theyre going to go nuts. Theyre going to go nuts. They thought they got me. They said, Okay. Have you heard them recently Okay. Hes building the wall. And you think its easy getting that kind of money to build a wall when I have a whole party and a deep State and some never-Trumpers Theyre a dying breed though. The good thing, theyre on respirator. Theyre on respirator. Theyre on mouth to mouth resuscitation. You can do it. Im not doing it. Theyre on mouth to mouth resuscitation, the never-Trumpers. But you think its easy. Its not. But thats been built. But you know what they say now. Okay. Hes building the wall, but Mexicos not paying for it. Yes they are, actually. They are. They are. They are paying for it. And some of the fake news knows that, but they refuse to report it, but thats okay. Youll see. Youll see whats going on. And I want to thank Mexico because, by the way, right now they have 27,000 soldiers on our border protecting our border. We have Mexico protecting our border. And they only do that for Trump. They dont do that for sleepy Joe. They dont do that for crazy Bernie. And they dont do it for mini Mike, thats for sure. Theyre only doing that for Trump, right 27,000 soldiers protecting our border. In this region   thousand soldiers protecting our border. In this region of the country alone last year, ICE  Theyve been treated so badly, right They are great. Theyre brave. Theyre tough. Any men There are tough guys in here, but anybody want to be an ICE officer Its tough stuff, right They go into those nests. They call them nest. Thats where these guys get together and they knock the hell. I mean, if they have to  I have to be very careful. I dont want to get them in trouble, because the press wants us to be very politically correct. So let me change it around. They go into a nest of MS13, and they say, Oh, hello gentlemen. How are you On occasion, they have a fight. They never lose those fights. We need people like that. Hello gentleman. How are you How many people did you kill last year How many people did you get kill last year with a knife, because they like knives because its more painful. This is the kind of people that we were letting into our country. ICE has taken them out of our country by the thousands. By the thousands. Last year, ICE officers arrested 12,000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses, including robbery, rape and many for a thing called murder. On Wednesday we won the big case in federal court. Did you see that Did you see that We won the case unanimously. Unanimously. Federal appeals court, where we dont have to give money to sanctuary cities and States if they dont work with us, finally. Finally. Finally. Why should we Yet the Democrat candidates oppose all detention of illegal aliens. They want unfettered catch and release. We have ended that program. It was not easy. We have to go through courts. Everything is a court. Everything is a suit. We do anything. We turn to the right, they sue us. We turn to the left, they sue us. We win. But were winning. We have 218 judges now. Its good. Let me just preface that by saying I know they give fair opinions. It bears no relationship to who appoints them, but I never win with an Obama appointed judge ever. I dont win. No, we have great judges going onto the courts. Great judges. Theyre fair judges. Theyre judges that truly love our constitution. Its great. Theyre judges that if we feel its right, they dont want to invite the world to trespass across our borders. Very simple. The democrat field also supports deadly sanctuary cities that release violet criminal aliens. You know that. Youve been reading. All you have to do is pick up a paper every day. They release these horrible criminals to terrorize our communities. We dont do that anymore. We wont let it happen, and now we dont have to give sanctuary cities and states the money that theyre going to want. Its a whole game changer.  I dont think hes doing a good job. This guy doesnt know hes alive. Oh, what bad people. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75% since last spring, and we have ended catch and release permanently. You know what catching release is We catch them, we grab them. We say, Could we please have your address Address I dont know what the hell is an address They dont have an address. Could we have a number Do you have a phone Could we call your mother or your father and say in four years you have to come to court. What they do is they catch him, they get some information that the guy has no idea where he lives, and its one of those things in many cases, and then release. We release him into our country. We dont do that anymore. If you knew what it took  We catch them, and we take some information and we release them in, and we say, Please report back in four years from now for your trial. About 2% come back, and theyre the ones that are the dumbest people Ive ever seen. 2%. Nobody comes back. Its crazy, but were getting a change. It would be so easy. They call it loopholes. Loopholes. That word alone, they call it loopholes. It would be so easy if we had some democrat support. We dont have any Democrat support. They want open borders. They dont care about crime. Border Patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever in the history of our country this last year. We have deported record numbers of gang members. We are building the wall faster than ever, and we will soon be rebuilding more than one mile a day. Washington democrats have never been more extreme. 132 congressional democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders healthcare takeover. They want to take away your healthcare. While the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and to destroy your social security. Thats whats going to happen. My administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan of choice. Remember when President Obama would say, You can keep your doctor. You could keep your plan. 28 times. He said, You can keep your doctor and you can keep your plan. Well, he lied. We should impeach him. We should impeach him for that. He lied 28 times. Youll keep your doctor, keep your plan. Its wonderful. Great. Went through the roof. Were doing a great job. We killed the individual mandate, which is the most unbelievable, horrible. Its not really Obamacare anymore, but were running the hulk of it and were trying to kill it entirely, and then we will put it back. Youll have great health care, and preexisting conditions will be totally protected. Preexisting conditions will be totally protected. Were making healthcare better and much cheaper. While premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office, we are now offering plans already that are up to 60% less expensive than the old Obamacare. Think of that and better. And better. We are stopping surprise medical billing, a disgrace. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency, because when providers are required to show their prices, which they dont have to do, but now they do, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. Theyre just as good. I always like a name brand. I mean, theres something. Theres no difference. Probably sometimes theyre better. Weve totally transformed veterans healthcare, getting long ought VA choice and VA accountability passed after 50 years.  the spectacular right to try. You know what that is If youre terminally ill, you go all over the world. If you have no money, you cant. You go home and you die. Youre terminally ill. They go all over the world. If they have money, they go to Asia, they go to Europe. Theyre searching. We have the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest labs in the world, greatest technicians in the world, and we have pipelines of drugs coming out for different problems. Now, you sign a piece of paper. Were not going to hold anybody liable. You get to use that drug, and the results have been unbelievable. Unbelievable. Hopefully you dont need it, but now we have right to try. Theyve been trying for 51 years to get that approved. 51 years, and we got it approved. I guess Im good at getting things approved, arent I Those people that I brought up here where the reason too, every one of them. They were incredible. Thank you. Thank you. Senators, Congressman, they were the reasons. We are combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 32 years. We have launched new initiatives combating kidney disease, which is a big deal. Kidney disease is so tough that people die literally because its so much work. They die from overwork. Its just crazy. In theory, they could keep them going for a long time, but the work and the dialysis and all of the things they have to do. Weve done things that make it so much easier, and its just such an honor to be involved. Also, Alzheimers disease, were really making strides. Its really a great thing. Great thing. were pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for Americas youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. Virtually every Democrat candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb right up until the very moment of birth. That is why Ive asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God. The Democrat Party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and of course the late, great Abraham Lincoln. Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are a big tent. We are a big party. We are the party of big ideas for the future. This is where it is. This is where it is. this is not the old Republican Party. This is a very inclusive party. This is a great party. Republicans are proudly fighting for nationwide school choice, including right here in South Carolina. We want to give school choice to every child in America who needs it, from kindergarten to 12th grade, because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. Thats a big deal. This could not have been done by anyone but the Republican Party. They came to me, a group of people, and they wanted criminal justice reform. I wasnt sure about the issue, but we had a lot of great Republicans, very much in favor of it, including people that happen to be right here today. They were very much, and I started studying the issue, worked hard on the issue, and criminal justice reform. You saw Alice Johnson come out of prison. 22 years. She had another 20 years left. Think of it. For a phone call. For a phone call. A great woman, but we have many people coming out that shouldnt be there for anywhere near those terms. Not for those terms. But they came to see me, a group. A group of people came. Van Jones, he came up. Oh, thank you, sir. They needed four senators. They needed help. I called Lindsey, I called everybody. I called Tim, whos so great on everything. I called everybody. They needed four senators and maybe five, and they needed help with some of the ones that werent moving in the right direction. I gave it to them, and I got it, and it was not easy. We get criminal justice reform, and then I signed it. Then this Van Jones has a program that gets no ratings absolutely at all. They say, Van Jones wants to thank everybody for criminal justice reform. I called our great first lady over. I said, Darling, please take a look. Its going to be so nice, because honestly, look, they couldnt have done even close without me. I got all these people together, got them done. It was impossible. Previous presidents couldnt even think about it. They couldnt even think about doing it, and they tried, although I dont think they tried too hard, bur they could have never done it. So he gets up, and he starts by saying, I want to thank the Reverend Al Sharpton. I knew Al when he was very heavy. He looked better when he was heavy. Its true. Hes one of the few people, he really looked better when he was heavy. He looked much better when he was heavy. Ive got to tell him. I have to explain, because I know him very well. He would admit that he has a lot of respect for your president, but he cant admit it on television. But he called and he said, I want to take the Reverend Al Sharpton, and then name after name after name of people that I never heard of. My wife said, Are they going to think about you, right Are they going to think about you I said, Darling, of course. I said, Hes saving me til the end, because I was by far. Its true. This is true, Tim. Lindsay, this is true. I said, Hes saving me til the end. Its going to be such an honor to be recognized, because I dont get enough publicity. I need a little bit more. He got to the end and he didnt say it, and she looked at me. She sort of smiled. I think she loved it in a certain way. But she sort of smiled. She said, Thats too bad. I said, Yeah, it is. Then he said, I have one more thing to say. We must get out this year and fight and vote against this President of the United States. Can you believe that Its true Its a true story. Van Jones. These are just terrible that they could  I was a little embarrassed in front of our great first lady, but Ill live through it somehow. I recognized Israels true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years. 52 years that Golan Heights had been fighting and fighting for it. I did it, and I did the true capital, Jerusalem, right How many presidents promise that Every president for many, many decades promised were going to do that. They never did it. I did it. We did a lot. Weve invested more than 2 trillion in the United States military, including more than 150 million this year in Joint Base Charleston, Fort Jackson, and Paris Island. We created the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces, the Space Force. We have another branch. 72 years. Not for 72 years, the Air Force, have they done a new branch. We did the Space Force. When I first said it, everybody thought I was joking. I said, Im not joking. They thought it was from the comic strips or the future movies. I said, No, its all about space. In a number of years, people are going to say, I cant believe we didnt do this sooner. We need a little vision. We need a little foresight. You know what I mentioned Space Force. At arenas like this, it gets one of the biggest hands, because thats where its at. Thats where its going, unfortunately, or fortunately. We needed it for defense. We needed it for offense. Sixth branch. 72 years. For years, we watched as your politicians apologize for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of South Carolina. At stake in our present battle is the actual survival of our nation. I really believe that its the survival. You see these maniacs that were dealing with. They want to give away everything. We will end up being Venezuela large scale version. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, to secure, then we must devote everything we have towards a victory in November of 2020, November 3rd to be exact. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the swamp. I never thought it was this deep. Man. I talked about a swamp. You never told me it was this bad, fellas. That swamp is bad. You got dirty cops at the top of the FBI. You got a lot of dirty people, but you also have phenomenal people in the FBI and other places, but were draining that swamp. I never knew it was going to be this dirty, and were getting a lot of help from a lot of great people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. Thats whats happening. Think of it. From poverty to prosperity. Look at some of the stories that you have over there. Look at some of the incredible stories. Look at Tim Scott. Look at that incredible story. No, really. Its an incredible story. Lindsay will say it. I give about 99% of the credit to Tim Scotts mother. I do. I guarantee you, Tim, there was no games, right There was no games in your household. It was lets go to work, right Great mother. Thank you very much. Thank you. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system finally of immigration. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, infectious diseases like were working on right now, and ending the AIDS epidemic. Nobody thought this was possible in less now than nine years, and it should have been started before. We will end the AIDS epidemic. Who would have thought we could have done that We will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on Mars. You have to land on moon, and then you go to Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag, and we live by the words of our national motto, In God we trust. From Greenville to Columbia and from Myrtle Beach to Hilton Head to right here in Charleston, this state is home to some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth. Its true. Its true. True. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who have crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, lay down the railroads, revolutionized industry, liberated millions from poverty, hunger and disease, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. You have the best year ever on record, right Southeast, best year youve ever had, right You have a great governor, you have two senators, great congressman, the greatest year youve ever had, but some people in South Carolina are getting a little tired, Im surprised to hear this, of winning. Ive very surprised to hear this. Some actually called in two great senators into a big meeting, a town hall, and they said, Senator Scott, Senator Lindsay Graham, were tired of winning and South Carolina. Cant do it anymore. Its too much. Its too much. Weve had years where we werent winning, and it was okay. We couldnt get jobs. We took it easy, but we just want you to go and see your friend, the president, and we want you to represent us. We want you to say, Mr. President, South Carolina is tired of winning. We dont want to win anymore. We are tired, sick, tired of winning. Theyre going to come in and say, Sir, I hate to tell you, but the people of South Carolina dont want to win anymore. Ill say, Mr. Senators, let me tell you something. South Carolina does want to win. They want to win more than anybody, and were not going to change a thing, because were winning like never before. You know what Were going to keep it that way. Sorry, senators. Go back to South Carolina, senators. Go back to South Carolina, because we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of South Carolina, the best is yet to come. The best is yet to come. The best is yet to come, because together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, South Carolina. Thank you."
Yuma,Aug18,2020,"Oh, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And considering that we caught President Obama and sleepy Joe Biden, spying on our campaign, treason, will probably be entitled to another four more years after that. I wanted to thank you, and Art and Brandon, youre incredible. Ive known you now a long time. Right from the beginning, we had the chemistry, we had that good chemistry Oh, sit down. Its 122 degrees in this place. And we have our great Governor. Governor, can we make it a little bit, just a little. This is like a test. You think Joe Biden could do this I dont think so. So Im thrilled to be in Yuma, Arizona To proudly accept the endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council, thats a big deal. And they are great friends of mine. And were building the wall. Next week, well be up to 300 miles of incredible wall. And our numbers are the best. We are very tough at the border. When people want to come in, for our farmers, et cetera, et cetera, were not going to hurt our farmers, but weve never had better numbers than we have right now. And thats been helped because were at a little bit over 280 miles right now, we have never been helped like this. Wall, there are two things, in a thousand years you can come back, two things will never, with technology its obsolete before you even put it in the box, but two things never get old wheels and walls. Wheels and wall. If you come back in a thousand years, youll say, Well, we still have wheels in walls. And thats the only thing youll recognize. The National Border Patrol Council is the official union representing the incredible heroes of the United States Border Patrol. Theyve been my friends from the beginning. To every border agent, and I just met some unbelievable people backstage, these are great people, and every family member here today, you have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation. And I want to thank you very much. Thank you very much. As you know, better than anyone, the survival of our nation is at stake in this election. And I will tell you, I never thought Id say it because we had a great election. We had a great election a little while ago. Four years ago, I never thought Id say anything could compete with 2016. This election that were going into is the most important election in the history of our country, because we had crooked Hillary, but this is something, these people are sick. And we have to make sure that this radical left socialist and beyond, because this is beyond socialism, that it doesnt happen, or we will indeed have Venezuela on steroids. So we cant do it. Most important election, November 3rd, get out and vote. Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left wing movement that seeks the complete elimination of Americas borders and boundaries. They want to take the wall down, they dont want to have borders, they want to have sanctuary cities, lots of bad things they want. Following orders from his boss. I guess his new boss is Bernie Sanders. Can you believe that Crazy Bernie. Joe Biden has pledged to abolish immigration enforcement, suspend all removals, provide free government healthcare, and they want to give it to illegal aliens. You dont get it. Restore, catching and release. Shield violent criminal aliens. This is what they want to do. And give every illegal alien on the planet earth a free ticket to invent an asylum claim, and gain automatic admission into our country. We will have people coming into our country that never even thought of it before. You get free education, you get free healthcare, why wouldnt they come Lets go to America. The Biden plan would unleash a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen. Its crazy. Bidens plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous, and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate. It must be defeated, and it will be defeated on November 3rd. It will be defeated. At last nights Democrat convention, which by the way, got very bad ratings, I have to tell you. Unity. They talk about unity. They want to bring unity. And then you listen to Michelle Obamas speech, which was obsolete by the time it got there. She taped it. No, she taped the speech. It was obsolete. She must have taped it about three weeks before. Im speaking next Thursday, maybe Ill tape it. But I dont think that goes. Thats so much nicer, to tape it, you do it, nice air conditioned room. And she not only taped it, but tell me when you hear a divisive speech They talk about me as being a divider. Im not a divider. I bring people together. We were bringing people together. We were bringing people together, like never before. Success was bringing everyone together, and then we got hit with the China virus, but we were bringing people together. But one of the opening speakers last night said that America will go to hell if we dont have open borders. Think of that. Go to hell. When a country doesnt have borders, you dont have a country. Today, a Democrat speaker at the convention said, Were talking about abolishing the police, were talking about abolishing ICE, were talking about abolishing prisons. Bidens campaign has turned into a cult for open border and others Zealots. By the way, they want to double and triple your taxes, they want to increase regulations, they want to spend very little money on our vets, after we took care of our vets better than anyones. 91% approval rate. And they want to spend much less on our military, weve totally rebuilt. Two and a half trillion dollars, weve totally rebuilt our military. Bernie Sanders declared, in his speech, many of the ideas that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream. Thats Bernie Sanders. Because Joe, he doesnt know where he is. But if he did, hes been brought so far left that our country will not be the country that we know. It will have problems, it will go down. Your stocks will be gone, your 401ks will disappear. And right now, who has the 401k And then the rest of you, many of you have stocks, and you do it a different way. That will go down 50, 60, 70%, 80%. And if you held on, like I said to do, we went down a little while we got hit with a virus. Now, NASDAQ just broke an all time record. SNP, just broke an all time record. Socialism is the mainstream of the Biden campaign and its not the mainstream of America. Remember I said, we will never have a socialist country. On November 3rd. The people of Arizona, our great state, we love Arizona. I won it last time, by a lot. And I hear were going to win it by even more this time. Dont forget, last time I talked, I said were going to give you a tax cuts, I gave you. I said, were going to give you a massive regulation cuts. Give you your tax cuts, I gave them to you. I said were going to give you massive regulation cuts, were going to give you great everything. We even did Right to Try medicine. You know all about that. We did things that I didnt even talk about it, we did. We did a thing called the Space Force. You never heard me talking about. Im the only candidate that gave you more than I promised in the campaign. Its true. Im the only one ever, maybe ever. Or well head to the polls and together well stop the left and win four more years in the White House. Were joined today by some incredible people, friends of mine, great, great people. And I want to congratulate your governor because we had a spike and he knocked that spike out so fast. I dont know. Are you sure you even had a spike Doug Ducey, a great governor, great man, and a somebody that won by about 16 or 17 points. Thats not so bad. And I think youre more popular today. What a job youve done. Thank you very much, Doug. A friend of mine and somebody whos a great fighter pilot, and I had a lot of people tell me she could really wheel the Warthog, right The Warthog. She said, I love that plane, but she was a great, great fighter pilot, one of the best they were telling me. This was a group and they knew a very well. A lot of friends you have. And specifically she said, Could you extend that plane Thats the best plane. It never breaks down. It just is a winner. But Martha McSally is an extraordinary person, and shes fighting for us, and shes helping us, and we have to bring her into the center. Thank you, Martha. And shes running against a gentlemen who is, when you read what hes done, when you read what he said about the second amendment and about all other things, youre not going to want to vote for. Youre not going to want to have them play with your second amendment. Ill tell you what. If I werent President, I dont believe, Doug, youd have a second amendment right now. I dont think youd have. The pressure that was put on to get rid of it, or to basically obliterate it, make it so its meaningless. You will always have the right to bear arms. You will always have that. A few friends of mine who are warriors. Paul Gosar. Paul. Wheres Paul Paul, stand up. Will you Paul Gosar. Thank you, Paul. Appreciate. Great job youre doing. These are warriors. They really are. When they went and they tried to make a play at your President, they had to get through the House. What were we 197 and nothing. Thats never happened before. Everybody came together. The Republicans came. Other than Mitt Romney, one half a vote. One half a brain. Another friend of mine and incredible fighter, and somebody that loves his state, and Ill tell you, the Freedom Caucus, right And we have a man named Andy Biggs here. Hes a fighter. Hes a fighter. And he loves our vets, and he loves our military, and you love our second amendment, right And were not going to do anything with it. They will destroy that second amendment. Just remember I said it, but youre not going to have to worry about it because its not going to happen. A woman who really distinguished herself, she became a star. She became a star overnight. There was nobody tougher. There was nobody smarter. There was nobody better than Debbie Lesko. Great job, Debbie. Thank you. We want her on our side. Right fellas We got to have her on our side. Also, thanks to Arizona Republican party chairman, I knew this was going to happen. I knew that she was going. She never stops. She never gives up. Kelly Ward. Kelly, thank you. Thank you, Kelly. Great job youre doing. Are we winning Okay, good. I think we are. Thats what they say. We better win. If we dont win, this country is in big trouble. Big trouble. Also a great friend of all of ours, former State Treasurer of Arizona, Jeff DeWitt. Thank you Jeff. And a man who didnt choke under pressure. I dont even know if hes here. I think he might be here. He never choked. He kicked for 11 years. You know what that is You ever see a golfer. They miss a three footer. They miss a three footer. They cant take it back. They choke, choke, choke. Well, kickers are the same. Right NFL kickers. This guy lasted 11 years. Hes one of the best kickers ever. NFL kicker, Jay Feely. Wheres Jay Where is Jay Hes here someplace. Where is he Jay What happened You couldnt get a good seat, Jay. I remember the 61 yarder. That was a heartbreaker. Right But the only thing is, Ill bet you this man would stand, only stand, for our National Anthem. Thats one thing. Thats one thing I can tell you. And if they dont stand for our flag, if they dont stand for our National Anthem, I turn off the game. Other than that, Id like to watch, but I turn off the game. And by the way, I thought they learned that lesson a little while ago. I thought they learned that lesson two years ago, but maybe not, but they will. Theyll learn it again. This time itll go even faster. For decades, Washington politicians like Biden allowed an endless supply of illegal foreign labor to decimate American jobs and wages. Also, the crime was incredible what happened. They allowed criminal gangs to menace, maim and terrorize innocent citizens. They came in. They would maim and terrorize, and we have done something with our border patrol. And by the way, ICE, ICE is great. ICE has taken out thousands and thousands of MS-13, and you dont want the job. Theres some tough people here. None of you want the job. Its a tough job, but they like it, and theyre great Patriots, and theyve done a fantastic job. They ceded control of the border to the most dangerous and ruthless cartels on earth. This is what would happen. They have ceded. And what weve done, did you ever notice the caravans What happened Debbie, there are no more caravans. What happened What happened to the caravans They dont come up anymore. The caravans dont come up. You know, we were paying hundreds of millions of dollars to Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, hundreds of millions. And I said, Well, why are we doing that And they wouldnt take. When we caught a murderer and we wanted to bring it back to one of those countries, they wouldnt take him. And they wouldnt take him under the Obama administration. So we got stuck with them because theyd fly in. Theyd say, Dont land your plane. And I said something very simple. I said, Thats okay. We dont have to do that. Were not going to pay you anymore. We stopped payment. We stopped payment. Its amazing how that works, Doug. Right We stopped payment and they called. They said, Wed love to take them. Wed be honored to take them. So we take them back by the thousands, by the thousands. They let lethal poisonous drugs pour freely into our schools and our communities, but no more. Its not happening anymore. The cruel and heartless portrayal of the American people ended the day I took the oath of office, and now that we have more than half of the wall built, and do you notice they dont talk about the wall anymore. They dont talk. Why dont you talk I went, Look at all those people back there. Thats called fake news, fake news. Look at them. Its the fake news. They dont talk about the wall anymore. See, we won. We got the wall. Its going to be up to 300 next week and its going to be finished very soon. And as soon as we want, all of a sudden, they never talk about it. But you know where I talk about it Numbers. The numbers are so good. The numbers are so low. Weve never had numbers like this because that big portion of wall already built, you dont get through it. You cant get through it. You can climb Mount Everest, and youre going to have an awful hard time getting over that sucker. I stood up to the lobbyists. Everybody fought us, the Democrats, everyone. I fought the special interests. I kept every single promise that I made, and now Im doing it with the drug companies. I just created Favorite Nation. So if a nation buys it for less and they buy it for a fraction of what we pay, the drug companies have to sell it to us for the same price. And theyre spending so much. Theyre spending millions of dollars on advertising. Anytime you see an ad from a drug company, and theyre rich, the farmer, its called Big Farmer, the number one lobbyist. They spend millions and millions, hundreds of millions of dollars online. Anytime you see, anytime at all, you see an ad by Big Farmer against me, you know your drug prices are coming down. Thats what it is. Theyre not happy. And were giving the rebate that creates tremendous wealth for the middle man, the rebate. Its going to the people now. Were bringing the rebate and its going to the people. They are not happy. I have a lot of people in that industry do not like me too much. But you are going to get 50. You are going to get, and the Democrats would never do it, Biden would never do it because he doesnt understand it, but they would never do it. They would in a million years, they wouldnt do it. It took a lot of guts to do it. I had a lot of people, a lot of good politicians go, Sir, I dont think you should do it. I wonder why youre saying that, but we did it. Were going to have drug prices reduced over a very short period of time, by not 2%, and last year they went down a little bit, first time in 51 years that drug prices went down but a little bit, were going to have prices dropping 50, 60, and even 70%. Drugs. About time. And Im proud to say that theyve achieved the most secure border, our border patrol, in the history of the United States of America. We now have the most secure border weve ever had and its only going to get better. And we want people to come in, but we want them to come in through merit, right And we want people-  people to come in, but we want them to come in through merit, right And we want people that are going to come in and are going to love for our country, not hate our country. Here in Yuma, Arizona, weve invested over 1.7 billion and poured 180,000 cubic yards, thats a lot of concrete, to build 108 miles of powerful border wall. I know whos going to vote for me. I dont know though, I think Im going to win Yuma. What do you think, Doug I think, when I hear those numbers, when we hear those numbers, were winning. Were going to win Yuma big. Now you see it and you see whats going up and its an incredible structure, all capable, all wired up for cameras, for everything you can have. Technology is incredible. In total, Ive already completely planned for the final execution, were going to have, by the end of the year, everything that we said is going to be built. We may actually build some more in some soft areas that weve noticed over the last two years. So we actually may put up some additional, but we will have it completed, everything we said, by the end of the year and nobody thought that was possible. And weve reduced illegal border crossings by 60% since this time last year. And if we keep going at the rate, itll be about 85% in about two months. So its a great honor. And you know what Your community is much safer, you see the difference, its a much safer place to be. But more important than these numbers is the fact that weve ended catch and release. You know what catch and release is These great men and women catch somebody, maybe a murderer, maybe a rapist, maybe a trafficker, they catch somebody, take his name, take his number and they release them into our country. And they say, Come back in four years, you have a trial. No more. We take them out. We bring them out. And nobody said that was possible because I couldnt have gotten it through the Democrats because they dont like that. So we have people coming in to this country, some great people, some really bad people too. And I mean murders and I mean rapist, I mean really bad people and they dont get in and they dont get back. When we bring them back to their country, could be Mexico also, they dont come back. Under the Obama Biden, I call it OBiden, Under the OBiden administration, our agents were ordered to ignore the law and release illegal aliens by the hundreds of thousands. And by the way, Mark Morgan, wheres the great Mark Morgan Hes around here someplace. Mark Morgan has been so incredible, one of our executives, he said, We never built the cages. Those cages were built in 2014 by Obama. We never the cages, they were built by Obama and the fake news is constantly saying that I built cages for children. I didnt build them. They were built in 2014. There was a headline in Time magazine about the cage and somebody called in that built it. They said, He didnt build it, we built that for the Obama administration. But they dont stop, they keep calling it, they say I built the cages. Youll hear it in one of the debates. Theyll say, You built cages president. I said, No, I didnt build cages. That was built by Obama. Under the Trump administration, if you cross our border illegally, you are quickly apprehended and swiftly returned back home. We are proudly defending the job safety and security of the American people, which is what I promised to do. Nobody told me it was going to be this hard. Nobody told me I was going to have the Democrats go totally crazy. This was like a life and death war. You know why they dont talk about it anymore Because they know its bad politics, because they know having a wall, they cant win that one. So they just say, Lets forget it ever happened. Because we won and they say, Lets forget. They dont want to talk about it. That includes the millions of incredible Hispanic Americans who follow our laws, uplift our community and protect our nation, in uniform. Half of all border patrol agents are Hispanic Americans, I was just with them. And today I salute each and every one of those true American heroes and thats what they are. And nobody understands the border better than Hispanics. They know whats good, whats bad. They dont want bad people coming into our country, taking their jobs, taking their homes, causing crime. Hispanic Americans are the people that are most in favor of what were doing on the border because they understand it. They understand it better than anybody. With the help of these patriots, weve stopped the rampant asylum fraud, shut down the human smugglers and were finding the drug dealers, traffickers, predators, and were throwing them to hell in jail or sending them back home. MS-13, for the first time that youve ever seen this, MS-13 is totally on the run. Many of its leaders are right now behind bars and were deporting its members in record numbers weve never reported. I cant believe how many there are. But if Biden wins, it will be a giant jail break for MS-13 and vicious criminal gangs. China wants him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. When we win, Ill have a deal with the red within a month, watch, because theyre dying to make a deal. But that last hope that Biden will win, they will own our country, China, they will own our country. We made such a great deal. Last week they had the largest order of corn in the history of our country, the largest single order. Then they did it again. You know why theyre doing that Because they know Im angry, because they know I dont care so much anymore. We made a great trade deal, but I dont care. But it shows you how smart they are, Doug. Another with normal brain power, theyd say, Well, Im not going to buy any more corn. Thats good. And well just decouple, thank you very much. But they go the opposite. They buy so much, good record numbers, soybeans record numbers. Last week, biggest ever, 42% of our farmers crop is now China, over the last little while. You know why Because they dont want bad things to happen, thats why. So theyre very smart. When I have every farmer in the country calling and saying, Please dont do anything. Theyre very, very smart, but we can never forget what China did to this country and did to the world. The historic achievements that Ive discussed today are only a slim fraction of the extraordinary accomplishment that weve all done together in the last four years. Heres just a short list of our landmarks. Really they are landmarks, true landmarks. We instituted a national security travel ban on the worlds most dangerous regions, including jihadist regions, keeping terrorists and extremists out of our country. Everyone said, Oh, thats so bad. Remember when they said, Oh, thats so bad. I dont think its so bad at all. We won the travel ban. The fake news said we didnt because we lost in the lower court, we lost in the second court and we won in the Supreme court. So they said we lost. Can you believe it They said we lost Debbie, because we lost the first two, but we won in the Supreme court, so they said, They lost. I guess, technically theyre right, we lost when it didnt matter. But we have it. We have a great travel ban now for countries that are not countries where we want the people coming in. Over the last three years, ICE officers have made over 380,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of over 145,000 assaults, 40,000 sex crimes and 5, 800 murders. Over the last three years, border patrol and ICE have seized over two million pounds of fentanyl, heroin, meth, and other deadly narcotics. And you see it all the time. We stripped federal grant funding from deadly sanctuary cities. They want to have a sanctuary city, not going to be like the old days. We canceled the lawless policies of the previous administration and empowered border agents and ICE officers to do their jobs and proudly enforce the laws of the United States of America. We removed 20,000 gang members, including 4,500, MS-13. Thats pretty good. Who would ever think theres that many I entered into three landmark agreements with Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala to end the abuse of the asylum system. We cut down that payment that I was talking about substantially and theyre still very happy and they are working with us very well and that includes Mexico. Right now, Mexico has 27,000 of their soldiers on our Southern border, helping us to guard our Southern border. And were giving you the tools to do the job that you signed up for. Thats what weve done. I entered into a historic partnership with Mexico, known as the migrant protection protocols, to safely return asylum seekers to Mexico, while awaiting hearings in the United States. You know about that. We had to have them in the United States and we captured them, we had to keep him here. I said, No, no, we dont want them here. We want them outside. We got sued all over the place that we won. So now they dont come into the United States, they can wait outside. For the first time ever, the United States is now exercising our full legal authority to expedited removal. We dont have to go through years and years of litigation. You need Perry Mason to try and win. We ended the Obama Biden policy of giving work permits to newly arriving, illegal aliens. Think of that one. We established the national vetting center, the most advanced visa screening system, anywhere in the world. We know so much about the people coming in. We know the good and we know the bad. Weve suspended refugee.  Good and we know the bad. Weve suspended refugee resettlements from the worlds most dangerous regions, because nothing is more important than keeping America safe. To me, thats number one. Weve made historic progress to crack down on visa overstays. You know all about that. They overstay for years. They say, Maybe a night, maybe two nights. Well, five years later, you catch them. No, we ended it. We issued strict sanctions on countries that failed to take back their own criminals. We have many countries beyond the four that I mentioned, the three plus one, many countries. They all take them back now. Before, they werent taking them back at all. The last administration simply released these criminals. Were making sure they go home and were making sure they stay home. We dont want them. We issued regulations to stop the horrible practice of birth tourism. You know what that is, right Anchor babies, you know that, right Anchor babies. Have a baby in our country and you stay for the rest of your life. Congratulations. Youre a citizen for 90 years. Then you bring in your family. You bring in your family, right No. No good. I implemented a historic public charge regulation to finally and fully enforce the federal requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient, they cannot accept welfare for at least five years. To protect our country and our agents during the pandemic, my administration took immediate action to ensure the safe and rapid return of all illegal aliens. We brought them back. We have very few in our country now. We brought them back, can you believe it To protect US workers, I suspended the entry of low wage workers that threatened all of your jobs, American jobs, and were finalizing the new H-1B regulations to permanently end the displacement of US workers. In January after the China virus, after the outbreak, after the outbreak, the China virus outbreak, it came from Wuhan, right I swiftly implemented a travel ban on China and I was criticized. Biden, opposed the ban. He said, I oppose the ban. He had no idea what the hell he was doing. Why do you oppose it, Joe I dont know. They told me to say that. If we had listened to Sleepy Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional American lives would have been lost. We did a good thing. That was in January, I imposed it, very early. A month later, Pelosi and all these people said, Oh no, let people come in. We cant. We imposed it because China was heavily infected. Then I imposed it in Europe also, heavily infected with Italy and France and Spain. Compare our achievements with the insane and lethal policies that Biden and Bernie Sanders want. The entire Biden Harris. How about her Is she a great one Is she By the way, you talk about guns. She wants no 2nd Amendment. She wants to raise your taxes to a level youll be paying your government back for a long time. She is not the right pick, but she was my number one draft pick. They asked me that. Why do you think I said, Im very happy. They thought I was happy. They thought I was happy for him. No, I was happy for me. The Biden-Harris plan is a step by step recipe for abolishing Americas borders. In the Biden, Bernie manifesto, Joe Biden, promises to restore and expand catch and release across the entire US border. You believe that We just got rid of it. Free all illegal aliens from federal detention and close detention facilities, this would make removing illegal aliens totally impossible, and you would have murderers, killers, rapists in your midst. I dont think so. Immediately suspend all removals, triggering a tidal wave of, really a flood, if you think, a flood all across our border. End prosecution of illegal border crosses ensuring that illegal aliens will repeatedly reenter the country over and over again and terminate all protections we have enacted against asylum fraud. They want to do things that nobody thought was even possible to contemplate. Now, this is all simple and I really respect because so far Ive only seen about four or five people go down. Because it is hot in here. But I will tell you this Its 120. You know what I said before Think of yourself at a great spa, great sauna, where its 120 degrees and we have to pay a lot of money to be there. You have to pay a lot of money. Getting off the border, getting off illegal protection, all of that, we are going to lower your taxes further. We gave you the biggest tax decrease in the history of The biggest tax decrease in the history of our country. We decreased your taxes more than anybody has ever done and were doing more because thats going to spell growth and thats what happened. Companies are moving in like nobody has seen before. So were doing that. Massive additional regulation cuts. Weve cut regulations more than any president in the history of our country, whether its four years, eight years, or in one case, more. I told you already, our military is the best its ever been. Its got 2.5 trillion worth of new, beautiful jets and equipment and rockets and everything. Hopefully, we never have to use it. Our nuclear arsenal, and hopefully, hopefully we never have to even look at it, our nuclear arsenal is at a level that its never ever been before, and we have to have it there, but we never want to use it. So we have done things not only on the border, the border is one element, and to me its very important. Something that they always say about a president, the most important thing a president can do is the appointment of federal judges and supreme court justices. So by the end of our, of not my, our first term, we will have appointed 300 federal judges and appeals court judges, and two supreme court justices. When it comes to 2nd Amendment, when it comes to life, when it comes to a lot of things that you people live for, if you dont have the supreme court and if you dont have the courts in your side, you can forget it. The next president, I think, will pick two, three, or even four justices of the supreme court. They can be on the court for 40 to 50 years. You pick them young. They could be on there for 40 to 50 years. This is going to be the most consequential presidency. This is going to be the most important, and I never thought Id say it because of what happened four years ago, this is going to be the most important election of your life. So I just want to Thank you. I just want to say stay healthy, stay sharp, be careful. Be very careful. Go out and work like hell. We need every single vote that we can get because its probably going to be close. I always assume its going to be close. They have these suppression, the fakers back there, they have the suppression polls where they interview many more Democrats than they do Republicans. Doug and I were talking about it and they take out registered voters. Its not registered. They say, Most likely to vote voters. Thats what, most likely registered, theyre dead, theyre old, theyre not going to go, theyre not going to do anything. Be careful with your ballots, but get out there. November 3rd is the biggest date, one of the biggest dates in your life, in many cases, frankly, its the most important date of your life. One other thing weve done lot. Weve gotten rid of a lot of nonsense from Obama, like the Paris Accord that costs us tens of billions of dollars and gave us nothing. Weve gotten rid of so many different things that you have no idea, but you know what If we dont win, they can put it back, and with the things that we did put in, which are many, many, many things, many things, our military, our vets, everything, with all of the things that we put in, its like a tree, it takes a little while to grab on. You transplant it. Its got to grab on. If we have four more years, theres nothing that they can do. Our country is sailing. our country is sailing. So Yuma, thank you very much. Arizona, thank you very much. Thank you for all your support. We love you. We will never ever let you down. We will never let you down. Governor, thank you. Martha, go out and win. Go out and win. Vote McSally. Thank you everybody."
Phoenix,Feb19,2020," Thank you very much, Phoenix. We love to be back. Well be back a lot. Were going to win that election. Thank you very much. Hello, Phoenix. Its great being here in the great state of Arizona with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family, and country. Thank you. Thank you. And with your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats and we are going to win Arizona in a landslide. Its all over TV that the folks here tonight have helped a great World War II veteran into the arena. I dont know if he knows it, but hes right now the hottest celebrity in the world. I dont know whats going on here. He might even be hotter than Trump right now, I have to say. Did you see the scene No, hes all over television. Even fake news CNN him on. They say hes a legitimate great hero of World War II. Erwin Julian. Irvin, thank you. And I asked my son Don to get a couple of hats and get some things, and give them to Erwin right now. And I want to thank you. Really, thats a great honor. And thank you for the great job youve done. An American Patriot. Thank you very much. Thank you, Don. How did Don do tonight Okay Hes good. Good guy. And he loves this country. So this is truly an incredible time for America. We have the best economy, the most prosperous country that weve ever had, and the most powerful military anywhere in the world by far. Do you remember the good time we had a week ago at the State of the Union You remember that, right And that was my honor. But I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. Our country is stronger today than ever before. And after three years, of very unfair and ridiculous witch hunts and partisan Democrat crusades It was the radical lefts pathetic attempts to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy, and overthrow our entire system of government. But guess what They failed, and our poll numbers are higher today than theyve ever been before. And were standing up to the defense of our Constitution, our freedom and democracy itself. Were doing something thats never been done in the history of our country. This movement has never taken place. Nothing like it ever. And the fake news can attest to it, because if they thought I was saying the wrong thing, itd be out there immediately. Itd be all over the place. Itd be all over the place. Trump exaggerates. Thats terrible what he says. There has never been a movement like this, and it began very early. It began in 2016 with that wonderful, beautiful night. You remember that, right That beautiful night in November. And were going to have another beautiful night in November. This time, its going to be November 3rd. Get ready, November 3rd. Were coming. Were coming. So were having great polls. Youre seeing the polls, except for some of the fake ones. And if I was treated fairly Meaning, if you were treated fairly by the fake news, wed be up 20 points higher in the polls. There wouldnt even be a competitive election. Unfortunately, its probably going to be competitive. But I actually think were going to win by a lot, just like we did last time. But I really believe wed be up 20 points. I mean, all they do is negative, negative, phony stuff. Russia, Russia, Russia. The impeachment hoax. Thats a hoax. But you know, we had great support from the Republican party in the House. It was 197 to nothing. And in the Senate, it was 52 and-a-half to a half. You know what the half was A halfwit. And while the extreme left has been wasting Americas time with the hoaxes, weve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion and creed. By the way, they turned away 21,000 people outside, so feel very good. Feel very good. We havent had an empty seat. You know what We havent had True. We havent had an empty seat, and this is a tribute to all of us because this is a movement like nobodys ever seen. But we havent had an empty seat since your great and this is a great first lady. Came down the escalator with me in Trump Tower a long time ago. We havent had an empty seat. From our rural communities to our inner cities, were expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens. We added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. You saw that, the geniuses. You saw that. You saw that last month. They were doing predictions on one of the shows. What do you think Well, I think 60,000. What do you think I think 100,000. What do you think I think 84,000. These are the ones that tell you all about how to invest. What do you think And then they came out 225,000, the market goes up again. 225,000. 225,000. So many manufacturing jobs. So many that frankly, were never going to come back. Remember, you need a magic wand, right They came back. And remember this, were paying interest. The past administration didnt pay interest. They pumped money in like it was candy. And we didnt pump money in, we took money out. And not that I was happy about that, because I disagree with it. Because frankly, if we kept the old practice which frankly, some people could dispute one way or the other, we would have been up in my opinion, another 10,000 points in the Dow. And weve set 144 records on the stock market in three years, 144 records. 144 records. Record stock market. And you know what that means That your 401Ks are up 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. Guys come up to me. He said, Mr. President, I just want to thank you. My wife used to look at me like I was a total loser, sir. Every year we lost money for years and years. She said what the hell is wrong with you, Henry And this year sir, Im up 92%. She loves to me again. She thinks Im a genius. 92% 401K. She thinks Im a genius, sir. She loves me again. Shows what money can do, right But that makes And think of this. Seven million new jobs since we were elected, we were elected. And when I took over, ISIS was all over the place. And we immediately started. We have destroyed 100% of the ISIS caliphate. We have killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi is dead. And we just took out the worlds top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. And the fake news doesnt want to tell you that. They dont want to tell you that. They dont want to tell you. In fact, do you remember the dog Great dog, Conan. When we took out, right We love Conan. Conans a tough dog. But when we took out al-Baghdadi, Conan Remember this Conan got more publicity than President Trump. Thats okay. They were looking for al-Baghdadi for 16 years. We found him and we took him out. We killed another one last week. The head of Al-Qaeda. He was gone, dead. And America is respected again, respected like never before. Were respected again. Were no longer the laughingstock that gets taken advantage by every country, including by the way, our allies, who in many cases take a bigger advantage than our enemies. I will tell you that. They take big advantage, but not so much anymore. Were winning. Were winning like never before. Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They hate the fact that were winning. Were winning big. Were winning, winning, winning. And that is why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement. Theyre joining our great Republican party in droves. You see it all the time. I just spoke to some of your leaders. He said, This is unbelievable whats happening. This is unbelievable. You know, there have never been rallies like that. Sleepy Joe Biden the other day had 68 people. And now they have a new member of the crew, mini Mike. Mini Mike. No boxes, we call him no boxes. And I hear hes getting pounded tonight. You know, hes in a debate. I hear theyre pounding him. He spent 500 million so far, and I think he has 15 points. It just came out. Hey fake news, how many points does he have right now, 15 They wont tell you the truth. They wont tell you the truth. MSDNC, MSDNC is worse than CNN. Theyre owned by a company called Comcast. You can have Comcast, a bunch of phonies. But MSDNC is worse than CNN, and theyre all pretty bad. You know, they just came out with a poll. They just came out with a poll a little while ago. Mini Mike was at 15, and crazy Bernie was at 31. Thats a lot. And mini Mike just spent 500 million. But the DNC is going to take it away from Bernie again. Thats okay, because we dont care who the hell it is. Were going to win. Were going to win. We have to. Well let me tell you, these crooked politicians, they really took away three years from us. Because despite the fact and nobody disputes it, that weve done more in three years with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and the military and the choice and everything, weve done more than any administration in history. Weve done more. But think of it, think of it. We did it with phony witch hunts. We did it with the impeachment hoax over our head the whole time. We did it under circumstances that should never ever happened to another President again. True. But with your energy and enthusiasm this November, were going to take back the House, were going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So were thrilled to be joined tonight by some of the best, greatest. I love them. Leaders in America, Arizona leaders. I want to start. Come on up here, Governor Doug Ducey. Come on up here, Doug. Come on up here. Youre going to speak in a second. Also, I call them warriors because they fought like hell. They worked with our future Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. But we have some of your great warriors. Paul Gosar, come up here, Paul. Come up here. Andy Biggs. Andy Biggs, head of the Freedom Caucus. Andy Biggs. David Schweikert. David, come up here. A big, big star. You know about that, Doug. She became this monster star. She looked with such indignation at the other side, such disgust, Debbie Lesko. Hell be running some day. You said your grandson Wow. Hell be running someday. Arizona Senate President, you know who that is, right Karen Fann. Come up, Karen. Arizona House Speaker, Rusty Bowers. Vice President of the Navajo nation, Myron Lizer. And Arizona Republican party State Chair, Kelly Ward. Kelly Ward, come up. And we have a lot of other leaders, but weve got to get back to speaking. Do me a favor before I introduce a very special guest, Id like to ask your great Governor You know, he won like by 16 points. It wasnt even a contest. You know, Im very competitive. I want to beat him. Will you please get out to the polls so we can beat him But hes tough to beat. Doug Ducey, say a couple of words, please. Please. These are great people, great people. Thank you very much. So you know, before I introduce somebody very important to all of us, to me Also, I have to say with us tonight is an Arizona hockey great, a friend of mine. Hes a great golfer too. Hes a tough golfer. Ill tell you, hes tough to beat. Hes tough as hell. And if you beat him in golf, hell try and beat you physically. He doesnt care. He was the toughest hockey player. He was one of these guys, he could beat you one way and if he couldnt, he just beat them up, right Hed beat him up. And hes a friend of mine. Hes a great guy, Jeremy Roenik. Wheres Jeremy Where is he Thank you, Jeremy. Hes a winner. Were also joined by Donald, Jr. and Kimberly. Theyre great people, great. And RNC co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. And RNC finance chairman, also happens on a team called the Chicago Cubs, I shouldnt tell you that Todd Ricketts. So finally, its my great honor to introduce a tremendous person, a great fighter pilot. A lot of people dont know that. Shes a great fighter pilot and a warrior Senate. She helped us so much during the impeachment hoax, she didnt wobble one bit, Martha McSally. You know, Marthas tough on the border. And shes working with me to strengthen our military still further, and lower your prescription drug prices. Were making a lot of progress. But her opponent, I have to say this Martha, a guy named Mark Kelly. Even the Democrats dont like him much. He wants to raise your taxes, open your borders, give away free healthcare to illegal immigrants, and he wants to obliterate your second amendment. He wants to get rid of it. The radical liberal Democrats from California and Massachusetts, theyre pouring money into Kellys campaign, because they know that hes a rubber stamp for crying Chuck Schumer, crying Chuck, and nervous Nancy wacko Pelosi. And were going to have a new Speaker. But thats why Martha has my complete and total support and endorsement, and we have to all get out there and make sure that Martha McSally Shes a warrior. Let me tell you, you dont know. We dont know. People dont know, people. This one is tough as hell, and thats what we need. Martha McSally. Thank you. Well be back. Thank you Martha. Well, shes right. How about that Congressman Al Green We cant beat him, so we have to impeach him. How about that Thats not what our as they call them, the founders. How many times did you hear the name, the founders Thats not what the founders had in mind. But were going to have a big, big election victory. Were working to- But were going to have a big, big election victory. Were working together. I dont think the Republican party has ever been more unified than it is right now. I really dont believe so. So whatever you can do for Martha, we need her. Its been so incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you for everything, Martha. I appreciate it. Thank you. Together were building the worlds most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere. Were inclusive. This is the Republican party. Were inclusive. Right here in Right You know that. Right here in America, right here in Arizona, weve created 240,000 new jobs right here. Including over 60,000 new manufacturing and construction jobs here. Nobody thought it was possible. Youve had the best year that youve ever had. Arizona, youve had the best year, the most successful year that youve ever had in the history of the country. Its the best year youve ever had. So Im going to take all the credit away from your governor. I dont care. No, we have a great team with Doug and everybody else, but youve had the greatest year. You know that, Doug, number one year in the history of your state. Its an incredible achievement. Incredible achievement. I dont know, this has to be pretty good stuff on the debate stage. Well talk about, Well, you had the best In many states, the best year theyve ever had. Then they said, Lets get a new president. I dont think thats going to work so easily. The countrys had the best year its ever had. Lets get a new president. Lets put in crazy Bernie. Lets go. Crazy Bernie. Unemployment has reached its slowest rate in over 51 years, half a century. The average unemployment rate for my administration Think of this. The average, so were talking about now more than three years, is the lowest for any US president in recorded history. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached record lows, lowest in history. African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low in the history of our country. African American and Hispanic American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women has reached the lowest level in 71 years. Soon to be historic. And veterans unemployment has dropped to a record low. Were working with our veterans, were taking care of our veterans like nobodys ever taken care of our veterans. The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached the lowest level in history. Workers without a high school diploma, you have a lot of them. They left high school. They said, I should have finished. They left. They cant go back. They left. Weve achieved the lowest unemployment rate without a diploma ever recorded in US history. Isnt that great Theyre great numbers. Hispanic Americans right now, more than 500,000 own a home. More than 500,000 more own a home. And weve lifted 10 million people off of the welfare rolls. Think of that. 10 million people have come off of the welfare rolls. And happily. Not that we did anything. They have jobs and they love them. Theyre making much more money and they love getting up and going for work. If they dont like that job, they can get another one, because people are starving to get great employees right now. Theyre starving to get great employees. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47%, three times faster than the increase for the top 1%. Median income. Think of this. This is such a big deal. Median household income reached the highest level in the history of our country. Under President Bush, in eight years it went to 450 more. Under President Barack Hussein Obama, under a period of eight years, it went to 975. Under president Donald J. Trump Did you ever hear of him In only three years, including regulation cuts and tax cuts Because the other ones raise taxes. We cut taxes by the record amount. It went to 10, 000 per family. A record. A record. Thats why our consumer right now, our people, theyre booming with cash. Thats one of the reasons our economy is doing so much better. China had the worst year in the last 67 years. Asias doing poorly. Europe is doing poorly. The United States is doing great. Were doing the best weve ever done. The best weve ever done. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment, and these are really communities that need it the most, we created Opportunity Zones. We worked with Tim Scott, the great senator from South Carolina. His idea. He came in and saw me. I said, Lets give it a shot. Nothings worked over the years, but this has really worked. Now jobs and investment are now pouring into 168 newly designated Opportunity Zones right here in Arizona alone. From Apache to Navajo and Maricopa Counties. Were supporting working families by fighting pay. We are doing a job with paid family leave. Were doing something that nobodys ever done to this extent. Reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million American families an average of 2,200 in their pocket thanks to the Republican child tax credit. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring American liberty and cutting through job, killing red tape like nobody has ever cut regulations before. Weve ended the war on American energy, lowering utility bills, reducing prices at the pump, and eliminating our reliance on hostile foreign suppliers. For the first time, America is now energy independent. Such beautiful words. Energy independent. We fought wars. We did everything we could. We used to take the straits and everybody else benefited. Wed them clear so that other countries could take oil from the Middle East with That nobody paid us. Now theyre starting to pay us a lot of money, folks. They took advantage of us. But we have everything we need right now. We have made such progress in the last three years with pipelines. The Keystone Pipeline, Keystone XL. I approved it. The Dakota Access Pipeline. I approved it. 48,000 jobs. Were reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. The worst trade deals any human being has ever seen. I said, Who made these deals The worst, stupidest deals Ive ever seen. They were good for other nations. If you like other nations, thats great. But were now putting America first. Its very simple. For years, Washington politicians took money from lobbyists, global corporations, and really, the most corrupt special interests anybodys ever seen. To ship our jobs and our factories to other countries. We lost our taxes, we lost our workers, we lost our companies, and we did nothing about it. Now weve done a lot about it because companies are pouring back in. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA, the worst deal ever made, worst trade deal ever made, and one that was almost as bad and gave China an entrance into being a rocket ship when they entered the World Trade, WTO. One of the worst deals that we participated in this. By the way, we just won 7.5 billion in a lawsuit with WTO. We werent winning anything. We werent winning anything, but they said, I think this guys going to pull out. They treated us so unfairly. We were always in the minority position. I mean, who the hell negotiated these deals But they look at us and they say, Look, if were not treated fairly, were gone. All of a sudden, were winning all these cases. But we just won 7.5 billion. 7.5 billion. Did you know that, Doug 7.5 billion. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. Americas no longer for sale. America is no longer for sale. Those days are over. Two generations of politicians came and went promising to replace NAFTA. How many times have you heard were going to replace NAFTA Probably the number one reason I ran for office. Are we glad I ran for office I think so. Its funny, I was watching the different I find it fascinating. Im watching the different returns coming in and Im watching as much as I can of this stuff. I love it. We all love it. If you dont love it, youre not going to do it very well. The crazy New York Times, which was a dead newspaper when I ran, it was dead as a doornail. A month before I ran, Doug, I held up a New York Times, it was like what you get thrown in your face at a supermarket. It was a thing. It just flew away. There was nothing. Now its doing very well. But you know what Someday we wont be here. When were not, those papers are in big trouble. But this thing was a dead newspaper. But I was watching and they had an article this weekend about people that spent their own money and how theyre doing. They have Mini Mike has spent 411 million. Its a question mark, hows he going to Ill tell you how hes going to do. Hes probably not going to get the democratic nomination. Thats how hes going to do. But Mini Mike, 411. Then they had this idiot, Steyer. We call him impeachment Steyer. How did that work out, Steyer Hes another beauty. The guy worked He spent 210 million. He got one-third of 1% in Iowa. In New Hampshire he did much better. He got less than 3%. Guys in there for like 250 million. How did it work out, Steyer You jerk. I never even heard of him. I never even heard of him. I turn on every time For years, Im turning on Impeach him. They dont even know why. They never say why. They dont have any reason. Impeach the president. This guy spent a fortune on this stuff, so it worked out pretty good. But anyway, so then I go and I look. It has Mini Mikes Question marks. I can give you the answer, but right now they have to have a question mark, right Then they go down and they had other people. Some of them I like. They have Ross Perot, who honestly It was a tough day for Bush when he joined the campaign. Because Clinton didnt win. Ross Perot took away 19% of the votes. Didnt Clinton get 41 or 43% Give me a break. But thats okay. Whatever. But they had Ross Perot spent like 100 million, which is probably double if you bring it up to todays dollars. Then they have different people. A friend of mine who ran, Steve Forbes, he ran twice. He was in for a lot. Then they had Donald Trump. Now, this is your own money. This is your own money. I said Id spend a lot of money on my primaries. Well see how the hell we do. Its amazing. Once you win, money comes in. It comes in pretty fast. Whats that all about But so in the middle they had Trump, and then they had four or five that were behind me. Lot of money spent. Loss, loss, loss, loss, loss. But in the middle they have Donald Trump. It didnt say 500 million, and it didnt say 250 like this Steyer guy. It didnt say It said 70 million of my own money. I spent 70. It said, Donald Trump won the presidency of the United States. Right We won. My father would teach me, if you could spend less and win, thats better than spending a lot and winning. Crooked Hillary spent at least three times more than we did and lost. Crooked as hell. Shes crooked as hell. We have a double-sided justice. Its very unfair whats going on. Very unfair. But lets see how it all works out, folks. Lets see how it all works out. I hope youre going to be happy. I hope youre going to be happy, because there are a lot of dishonest slimeballs out there. Dishonest scum. Dirty cops, a lot of dirty cops. By the way, the FBI, those guys in that are incredible. But the ones on top, they were absolute scum. What they were trying to do, if that happened to Obama, or a Democrat, or especially a liberal Democrat, theyd be in jail for 50 years and it would have taken place two years ago already. They spied on our campaign. Remember that. After they spied, we won. Then after we won, they tried to get us out of office. Its never happened before in the history of our country, and we cant let that happen. We can never ever excuse it. We can never let them get away with that. Never let them get away with it. But we keep our promises that we work hard and our economy is great. The last month, we ended the NAFTA Look, you saw it. NAFTA catastrophe. Thats what it was. We ended that catastrophe. Again, I really ran because of NAFTA. I said, How stupid. All over the place. In your state, but you go to New England, empty factories, empty buildings. Still you have empty buildings. We lost so much. We lost 60,000 factories and plants. I signed that brand new, beautiful US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, and ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Arizona. By the way, for people with the small farms and small businesses, if you love your children, you can now leave your companies, you can leave your farm, you can leave your ranch to your children, and you dont have to to pay, they dont pay a death tax. They dont pay an inheritance tax. A big deal. Thats a big deal. So if you love your children, its good. If you dont love your children, it doesnt matter. Dont leave it to them, if you dont love. If your children are no good to you, dont give them anything. Let them go out and work like hell. No, if you love Does anybody in this incredible audience Man, this is a big building. Does anybody not love their children Anybody Do I have a hand Do I have a Theres a hand. Youve got to be kidding. Youve got to be kidding. So then you dont care about the tax. Okay, dont worry about it. He says, No, I dont care about that one. Well, thats good. You look like a nice guy too. Hes tough. Youd love to be his kid, wouldnt you But I also took the strongest ever action to confront Chinas massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Last month, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports. China will invest 250 billion a year into the United States and buy our products and create jobs. Nothing like that has ever happened before. After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. Thats the way we want it. We are finally putting our country first. We are putting America first. On no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than immigration. You know it almost better than anybody. Anybody, Doug. You know it better than anybody, what theyve done on your border, but were stopping that border. That border is clogged, and weve started the big wall right in Arizona. We build a lot of wall. Thats a big one. Thats a big one. Top of the line. Before I came into office, the far lefts policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country, poisoning our children. Including, as you know very well right here in Arizona, Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. They want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border. Then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare, healthcare, everything. They want to give them everything. For a long period of time, they were treated You know this before I came. They were treated far better than our veterans were treated. Now our veterans are treated great. True. Illegal immigration costs Arizona taxpayers more than 2 billion every year. Two billion youre paying. Nearly 20% of Arizonas annual budget in general funds goes toward this big problem. For the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild our cities all throughout America, which is what we should be doing. Under my administration, we are finally taking care of our own citizens, including millions and millions of legal immigrants who follow our laws, pay their taxes, and are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities. Every day, Democrats open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives. In Arizona alone last year, ICE officers arrested over 4,500 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. Right here in Phoenix, an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood, then walked over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he laid dying in the street. This savage animal had previously been deported after serving six years in prison. He was in prison six years. He was there six years and nobody wants to talk about it. They want to protect them. Last year in Tucson, another illegal alien was sentenced to 10 years for repeatedly raping a vulnerable young woman. Yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens, even convicted criminals, and they support deadly sanctuary cities that release these criminal aliens directly into Americas communities. Thankfully, Arizona has banned sanctuary cities. With a Republican majority in Congress, we will ban them in every state in America. 30 in the morning. I then went to California, made two speeches. I then went someplace else. I said, Am I finished No, youve got to go to Arizona tonight and speak in front of like 25,000 people. I said, Thats okay. Thats okay. I said, Thats okay. No, I said, Thats okay, because I love this unbelievable energy in this crowd. But you know what Honestly, theres tremendous energy in our nation. Theres tremendous energy in our nation. Greatest nation in the world. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row, which will soon be a record. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring. The month of January saw the fewest illegal border crossings in two years. And weve ended catch and release, a horrible Democrat policy that we got terminated. Border patrol, great people, have seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever recorded in the history of our country this year. Weve deported record numbers of gang members, including the worst gang of all, MS-13. Thousands and thousands of people have been thrown the hell out of our country. Weve done more to secure the border than any administration in history. Were building the wall, as I said, faster than ever. It will soon be almost one new mile a day. Were looking for that. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme, taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders. Hows he doing tonight 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernies healthcare takeover of the world. Think of this, 180 million Americans are going to lose healthcare coverage under this plan. But if you dont mind, Im not going to criticize it tonight. Let them keep going and Ill start talking about it about two weeks out from the election. Okay Because I dont want him to change. Please dont change. Same with the Green New Deal. I dont want to talk about it, Doug, tonight. I dont want to talk about it. I came up with the name Pocahontas. Too early. But fortunately, shes self-destructed anyway. Did you ever see a phony like that Shes a phony. She lost because she couldnt keep it straight on her own heritage. She said she was an Indian. I said,  I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none. She said, Oh, and she panicked. She panicked, and she had a test. You know the result, 1/124th. I think I win the bet. Somewhere along the line, I think I win. No, she I did it too early. I would have saved it, but I guess it was effective. Shes essentially gone-zo, so One of those things. While the socialist Democrats are try-  one of those things. While the socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare and your social security, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. And thats what were getting. Thats right. One of the big secrets. The Democrats wont let us say it. They want to keep that as quiet as possible. Look what they gave you, the worst healthcare. And what weve done, weve gotten rid of things that nobody could believe that was so bad for you. Everybody was happy with defending your right to keep your doctor and plan of your choice. Were making healthcare better and much, much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office, we are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive than they were, and its better healthcare. A lot of people dont know this. People dont know this. They think thats their issue. Its not. They failed on healthcare. Were protecting people with preexisting conditions, and we always will. And by the way, were trying to get rid of Obamacare, but were managing it incredibly, but were trying to get rid so we can give you a great healthcare plan and protect preexisting conditions. Remember that. Were trying to get rid of it, but while were having it, were managing it really much better than they did. Remember they built the 5 billion website Remember that It was supposed to cost 5 million. It cost 5 billion. 5 billion. I mean, you could get a kid out of high school. I have a son. Hes a young boy, 13. He uses a computer. He could have given them a healthcare site. I would say he would have charged them 100, Barron Trump, and it wouldve worked. Hes so good. Hi dad. How you doing, dad Hows it going Bing, bing, bong. I said, Dont play with that while youre talking to me. Whats going on, dad These kids are incredible, right The kids, they make us look like babies with that. But he could have given you a great site for about 2. They spent 5 billion on a site that never worked. By the way, speaking of that, how did they do with their vote count in Iowa And I hear, I hear, I dont want to say it. I dont want to jinx them because, of course, I want them to do well, but I do. We dont have anything. Nobodys running against us in so many states. Its sort of nice. We can save the thunder, right But I hear that in Nevada. Im hearing bad things about their vote count. I hear a lot of bad things are happening, like they dont know what the hell theyre doing. I turned on the other night, Iowa, I wanted to see  And by the way, we set a record in the history of Iowa. We had more votes than anybodys ever had as an incumbent president. Same thing in New Hampshire. Its a good sign. Its a good sign. By a lot. By the way, by a lot. But Im hearing that, and I hope this isnt the case because Id like to find out who the hell won. We still dont know who won in Iowa. I heard coming over here theyre still working on the count. No, no, no. He said, You won. Yeah, I think we did win. I think we did. Very good. Thats very good. I have to thank you, that one. Thats very good. No, we did win. Look, we are winning. Were winning big. We have fake polls out there. These guys do fake polls. They are fake polls. I had a poll. Its just like it was in 2016. Id hear these polls. Id hear women didnt like me, and I did great with women. I hear everyone didnt like me. Nobody liked me. Nobody liked me. And then we won. Thank you, women. Nobody liked me 2016. No, no, I hear that. Remember, women didnt like him, and at the end of that he did great with women. He did great with this. He did great with everybody. We did great with everybody. Remember, 306 to 223. Thats a slaughter. Thats a slaughter. Remember, they said he cannot get, they used the word path. There is no path, right, to 270 I was at 269 if I did great, but they said theres no chance. But I was at 269, so I went to Maine. I love Maine. I went to Maine. Maines cut in half. And one Maine has one. I went there four or five times. People are great. I won it. And they were right. There is no path to 270, but there was a path to 306. These people. These people. There is no path. Thats right, Doug. They said there is no path, the fake news media. There is no path for Donald Trump. And then they said the evening of the election, Its going to be a really short night for Donald Trump. Thank God, we got rid of this guy. Because they did the exit polls going out, right And I was even told, but a lot of people didnt want to talk about it. The highest number in history of people that said very nasty language, but Im not going to use that name because youll kill me if I use it. So I wont use it. Its a much better story if I use it because thats the truth. Thats what they said. How did you vote Usually, they say, I voted for Clinton, or, I voted for Trump. Right Howd you vote None of your business. See, Im being nice, right Ill keep it that way because otherwise well ruin the whole evening. Theyll say, His language, right Even this tough guy in the front says, I agree. How did you vote No, I dont want to tell you. How did you vote None of your damn business. Im not going to tell you. How did you vote Im not   And it was like this massive number, right Massive. So everybody, they just didnt count that. So they said numbers are looking unbelievably well for crooked Hillary Clinton. Theyre looking unbelievable. This is going to be a very short evening for Donald Trump. We finally will be rid of this guy. And then the numbers started coming in. The numbers started coming in, and it started with the great state of Florida. Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. And then that beautiful convention center, the most beautiful stage Ive ever seen. And they knew something was going on because they didnt pay the final payment for the fireworks two weeks before. Right In fact, I went to the fireworks company, and I said, Ill give you five cents on the dollar for your fireworks, even though they were no way near where my area was. We were at a hotel in Midtown. We liked the location better than where she chose, but they built the most  we remember that beautiful stage. It was shaped like the United States of America. And by the end, it didnt look too good. Did you ever see more unhappy people So they go, Donald Trump has won the great state of Florida. They go, Whoa, whoa, whoa. They outspent me like five to one. Only negative ads. Theyre all negative. So by the time people got into the voters booth, they only knew one thing. She hated Donald Trump, but they said, What the hell does she stand for What does she do Every ad was a negative ad. So it tells you negative ads, at least against me, arent so good. They can be effective. But I think they spent like  2 billion on negative ads. Everything was negative. So nobody knew what the hell she spent. You know, her husband said she was going to lose. Her husbands a professional. Her husband said, You better go to Michigan because I was there and they got a Trump/Pence sign on every lawn Ive ever seen. You better go to Wisconsin, Hillary. You better go to Wisconsin. She said, No, we havent lost Wisconsin in 36 years. No, no, Hillary, you got to go there. Im telling you, I dont like what I saw. No, what do you know Hes a professional politician. She wasnt. Its one of those little problems in life. So then it came in, and then we won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. Right And we were leading Pennsylvania by so much that if I lost, remember at 2% of the vote left, if I lost every single vote, I win by a lot. They refused, the fake news refused to call it. I kept saying, We won Pennsylvania. Why dont they call it It was very late in the evening when they called it because they are fake, theyre crooked. They are fake. And I said, Why dont they call Pennsylvania But some beautiful things happened. And by the way, Ohio, we won by one of the largest margins ever. The great, great, great state of Ohio. Remember Remember, they used to say a year before the election, they said, Well, nobody can win. Nobody, unless you win the great state of Ohio. And we won the great state of Ohio, and we won it big. We knew we were going to win it. And now were up a lot more than we were up even then, because you know why Were bringing back jobs. Were bringing back factories. Everybodys working. Nobodys ever had a better year than weve been having. And weve been doing it for a long time, right Almost from the beginning. And dont let them try and take credit, because if they came in, we would have ended up in a massive recession or worse, the D word, depression. We would have been, because they were going to put more and more and more regulations on. And Ill tell you, maybe bigger than even the tax cuts, and I did it sooner, were the regulation cuts. We freed up our nation to go back to work. True. So then we won Wisconsin, and then we won Michigan because those companies, now theyre pouring back in. The auto companies are pouring back in, and Wisconsins doing great with the farmers that Canada was taking. You know, Canada was charging our farmers 287% tariffs for dairy products. Okay So what happens is this, were working on healthcare. Were fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I just signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very fast. Weve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the brand drugs, but they cost a tiny fraction. Weve totally transformed veterans healthcare, including getting long-sought VA choice and VA accountability, which they said could not be done. And we passed the spectacular right to try. So if youre in trouble, and I hope nobody in this massive arenas in trouble, but if youre in trouble, you can go and get whatever the new drug or whatever where we have the best doctors, best hospital, best labs. You get it. And the luck we are having, we are saving so many lives. Its incredible whats happening. People would go to Europe. Theyd go to Asia. If they had no money, theyd go home and die. Now they have the right to use our drugs before theyre approved. Think of that. Before theyre approved. And were very importantly combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths. The overdose deaths have declined for the first time in 34 years, and life expectancy is rising again in our nation. Weve launched bold new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimers disease. Were making tremendous progress, and were pursuing new advances in neo-medical research. Think of that, neonatal research, the numbers are incredible. Whats happened is incredible, to care for Americas youngest patients and breaking all records in doing so. All of the radical Democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb right up until the very moment of birth. That is why in my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late-term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total destruction of your Second Amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, the Second Amendment and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm. We have tremendous energy. Tremendous energy. Everybody says to me, Where do you get the energy Because I love what were doing. I see the results, and theyre happening faster than you even think. You see the numbers. Theyre happening faster than you would even think. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We are the party with big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. Right Right To keep our community safer and give former prisoners a second chance at life. Theres been nothing like this. I passed criminal justice reform, not the Democrats. I did it with the Republicans, and this could not have been done by anybody but me and the Republican party. The Democrats did not do it. They could never have done it.  Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. We have invested 2.2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, including nearly 200 million for Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. Right I recognized Israel as the true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. We recognize Israel sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Theyve been trying to get it for 52 years. And for years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. You saw that. They apologized. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Arizona. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. It is. This election is so important. Its the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020. Youre the forgotten people no more. Right No deplorables, right No deplorables. Who knew that was going to turn out to be such a disaster But you know, she used the worst word. What was the word she used Irredeemables, right I thought that was the problem. No, it was deplorable. So what the hell do I know about politics She said, Youre irredeemable and deplorable. I said, Oh, that irredeemables terrible. The next day people are showing up. Women, Im a deplorable. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp, which is vicious, horrible, ugly, and evil. Much worse than I thought. But were getting there and not pleasant. A bunch of really bad people, very dishonest people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words and phrase. I love the phrase, Made in the USA. Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within now nine years. We started a year ago. Can you imagine that Were doing that, and its going to happen. Who would have thought we could have done that We will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, and you know this. You know its under siege, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will defend it. Its under siege. Its under siege. You see it in Virginia. They want to take away the guns. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto In God We Trust. From Tucson to Tombstone, right Do you agree You agree, right Look at him. Hes agreeing, this guy. Hes agreeing. No more censorship is right. No more evil. No more crimes. Youre right. From Yuma to Mesa and from Flagstaff to right here in Phoenix, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American Patriots who poured their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our freedom. Arizona was founded by pioneers and prospectors, great prospectors, cowboys and miners and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, braved the blazing sun, and it is hot here. Ive been here during the summer. I want to tell you, its seriously hot. Of course, didnt they say that President Clinton, when he went on the back of the plane was here to play golf, it was 121 degrees that day I dont know about that. I dont know about that. What do you think he was doing with the Attorney General I remember he said, Oh, I just happened to see she was  I was here to play golf. It was 120 degrees out. I dont know. A lot of crooked stuff went on. I wonder what they talked about. Im sure it wasnt that she would become a Supreme Court Justice. Im sure it wasnt that they were going to extend her tenure as Attorney General. She was a real beauty. Im sure it wasnt. Im sure it was nothing. They spent 45 minutes on the plane talking about golf and their grandchildren. Right Cant let it happen, folks. Cant let it happen. We cant let it happen. You fought the battles and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth, and we are making it greater every single day than ever before. Great, great, great citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and with your drive. We are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Do you like winning Because not very long ago you werent winning, and I dont want you  I told this a few times during the campaign. Havent used it in a long time, but I dont want you going to your great governor. Hes a great governor, Doug Ducey. I dont want you going to your governor saying, Governor, governor, we just cant stand winning so much. Please go see the president in the oval office. Governor, the people of Arizona dont want to keep on winning. Its too much governor. Its not even fair to the rest of the planet. Please tell him, Governor Ducey, please tell him, President, the people of Arizona have won too much. We dont want to keep on winning. And Ill look at Doug Ducey, and Ill say, Doug, Ive a lot of respect for you, Doug. You won by 16 points. That means a lot. But Doug, I dont care what you say. Were going to keep on winning, and were going to win like never before. And the people of Arizona are going to love it. And hes going to say, Thank you, Mr. President. Im going back home. The fact is, we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Arizona, the best is yet to come. Thats right. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you, Arizona. Thank you. "
Wildwood,Jan28,2020,"Thank you. Thank you. I love New Jersey and Im thrilled to be back right here in the Garden State. Thank you. The Garden State. Together were achieving historic victories for New Jersey families. You see it every single day. The New Jersey unemployment rate has reached the lowest of all time. More people are working today in the state of New Jersey than ever before. I have to tell you more people, almost 160 million, are working right now in the United States. Thats the highest level of employment in the history of our country. A lot of countries arent doing so well, just so you understand. Tomorrow we will replace the NAFTA nightmare, one of the worst trade deals ever in history, with the incredible brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA. A massive win for New Jersey workers, New Jersey farmers, New Jersey union people, New Jersey manufacturers and everybody. Weeks ago we also signed a fantastic new trade agreement with China that will boost New Jersey exports and defend New Jersey jobs. 250 billion coming in. Oh thats going to be so nice. Were restoring Americas industrial might like never before. Theyre all coming back. They want to be where the action is. After years of devastating defense cuts we have fully rebuilt the United States military. Thanks to the incredible courage of our warriors, the greatest warriors in the world, the ISIS caliphate has been totally destroyed and its savage founder, and leader, al-Baghdadi is dead. Weeks ago, at my direction, the US military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the worlds number one terrorist Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of Americans, and actively planning new attacks, but we stopped him cold. Yet Washington Democrats, like crazy Bernie Sanders and nervous Nancy Pelosi, they opposed our action to save American lives. They oppose it. They oppose it. You know the roadside bombs that you see hurting our people and lots of other people so badly The legs, the arms, wiped out. No legs, no arms. Soleimani loved that. That was his weapon of choice. We didnt like him. Hes not around anymore. Well we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the Congressional Democrats are obsessed with demented hoaxes, crazy witch hunts, and deranged partisan crusades. Its all they know how to do. The do nothing Democrats. They have spent the last three years, and probably even before I came down on that beautiful escalator with our beautiful future first lady, trying to overthrow the last election. We will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in the next election. We are going to have a victory thats even greater than 2016. This November we are going to win back the House, we are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep The White House. The American people are disgusted by the Washington Democrat  You see it. You see it. Which is worse, the impeachment hoax or the witch hunts from Russia But were going to be signing up millions and millions of registered Independents, Democrat voters. Today I had the best polls that Ive ever had since being elected. The best weve ever had. Remember I used to go over polls But I only used to talk about them when I was doing well otherwise I wouldnt. We had our best polls. Americans of all political beliefs are sick and tired of the radical rage filled left Socialists. I never saw anything  Whats going on in this country  Whats going on in this country, really the Democrat party is the Socialist party and maybe worse. Voters are making a mass exodus from that party and we are welcoming them to the Republican party with wide open arms. The Republican party is doing great. We are privileged to be joined tonight by a courageous leader who left the Democrat party because he has had enough of their extremism, enough of their Socialism, and enough of their vile hoaxes and scams. Hes had enough. I tell you he really is, hes a brave guy. He just said,  Im not doing it. Im not doing it. Its a hoax, its a scam, Im not doing it. We called him, Youre our kind of guy. Lets go. It didnt take much because he believes like we do. We are truly honored to be here with the newest Republican member of the House of Representatives, your great congressman, Jeff Van Drew. I have to tell you a few weeks ago Jeff was one of the few brave and principled Democrat lawmakers, in all fairness weve been after him for a longtime, who stood up to the House Democrats and the outrageous abusive power that you see going on right now. They cant win an election so theyre trying to steal an election. Its not happening folks. Its not happening. Jeff had the guts to defy the left-wing fanatics in his own party, and to stand tall in defense of our constitution, our freedom, and democracy itself. I just want to  I have to tell you, Ive gotten to know him really well over the last couple of weeks. Hes a great guy, hes a brave guy, he shares our values. He supports lower taxes, not bad. They want to raise your taxes. How did that work Jeff How did you get elected with that one Less regulation, a strong national defense. He loves our military, loves our vets, and police. He is a tireless champion for the state of New Jersey. He loves your second amendment, which is under siege by the Democrats. Jeff, its an honor to be with you. Please, please. Thank you. Thank you man. We have tens of thousands of people outside. If anybody would like to give them your place please let us know, but we have thousands and thousands. Tens of thousands. Jeff gave me a number, he said, 175,000 people signed up. Is that a fact 175 I think hes on his way. I think hes on his way. Thank you Jeff, great job. Thank you Jeff. Thank you Jeff. Its been a little bit of a story. You see the fakers back there Fake news. Fake. You know if another candidate has 1,000 people they say he spoke to a massive crowd. If they have 10,000, like Pocahontas went into Central Park in New York. This young men could have 10,000 people, you know that, in Central Park. She had 10,000 people like in Central Park. I said, Whats the big deal They made it, Oh the crowds are so large. Jeff just told you he had 175,000 people sign up. Seriously you have to see outside. They know because they have to follow, theyre trailers. I call them trailers. But theyre fake. Theyre fake. Theyre not honest. Let me just tell you, so heres the story, so we have these massive crowds that fill up stadiums every single time. We have tens of thousands of people outside. They never mention it. They never mention it, so maybe they will tonight. But thats an all-time record. This is not a brand new place and unfortunately it holds 10,000 people or less. We set the all-time record. You know why Because for games  See the floor packed with people For games youre playing ice hockey or basketball, so we broke the all-time record in this house. Its a wonderful house in a wonderful community. Also in Wildwood, like were in the middle of winter. There is nobody in the middle of winter and its a great place in the summer. Those streets are packed all the way back to the airplane practically. But on June 2nd everybody has to do us all a favor. Number one you have to get out and vote Republican. Get rid of these clowns. You have to get out and vote for really a brave man. What he did was incredible. Jeff Van Drew, what he did was incredible. Get out and vote. Hes going to have a big victory. Hes going to have a big victory. Were grateful to have with us this evening some wonderful friends of mine, people that Ive known forever, your former governor who did a terrific job, Chris Christie. Chris. Great Chris, great job. Your wonderful Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt, what a job hes doing. Thank you Doug. Thank you Doug. My campaigns two great New Jersey co-chairs and I think well play for the state  You know they all say Republicans cant win. Tell me why They said, Should you move this to the Meadowlands I said, No, I want to be in South Jersey. We want to be with our friends. But we could have filled up the Meadowlands arena two or three times. Maybe well do it during the summer. Should we do it during the summer Maybe. But two brave guys, two great politicians. People that love our state. State senators Mike Testa and Joe Pennacchio. Joe Pennacchio. Thank you Joe. Thank you. Thank you. Two incredible New Jersey natives, youve never heard of Kellyanne Conway have you say something. Thank you Kellyanne. I just want to thank Republicans because what theyve been doing is incredible. Republican leadership in this country were winning, winning, winning like never before. Were winning again and weve got a party thats a very different part, a much stronger party, a much more inclusive party. We have a party that we love. We have a party that has the votes. We have a party like theyve never had before. The Republican party respected again. I have to say this, America is winning again and America is thriving again like never before. Since the election we have created seven million new jobs. The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration, listen to this one, in United States history. Thats a good fact, the lowest in history. Thank you man. We have a great veteran up here and he said, We love you. We love you. The veterans. Are we doing good for the veterans Thank you. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country. Ever recorded Womens unemployment is at a 65 year low. Sorry about that. Soon its going to be historic. Another couple of good months itll be historic. 65 years for women. In the eight years before I took office over 300,000 working age people left the workforce. They had no choice. In just three years of my administration 3.5 million people have joined the workforce. Nobody believes it, including the fake  The workforce. Nobody believes it including the fake news. If I would have said that during the campaign that we were going to produce numbers like this, the fakeness would have been hitting me. Hes exaggerating. Hes lying, Pinocchio, Pinocchio. The press is very dishonest. More than two million millennials have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5% every year, which is a record. A record number of Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working, another record. Under the Trump economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of anybody. You dont hear that because this is a blue collar boom. Its very nice. Its about time. Its about time. Its been many, many decades. Earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10%, first time ever. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased, listen to this, by 47%, three times faster than the increase for the top 1%. Median household income is at an all time high. For President Bush, in eight years it was 450, over eight years. Think of this for a second. Under President Barack Hussein Obama, for eight years it was 975, so eight years, eight years, 450, 975 under your favorite President, and when you include the tax cuts, the regulation cuts that nobodys ever cut taxes like this. Nobodys ever cut regulations. Thats why all these jobs are being built. Under President Trump, for three years, the number is almost 10,000, and thats three years, and its going up. Its going up very substantial. Thats a big difference. New business applications in New Jersey have just soared to a record high, and we have lifted 10 million people nationwide off federal welfare. Theyre off. They are off federal welfare. Nobody wouldve believed these numbers. Someday theyre going to write the true story. Our child tax credit alone is delivering 2,200 a year to 40 million American families. We have ended, so importantly for you, the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. We dont need anybody elses energy anymore. Its so nice. What happened in the last three years with energy is incredible, but extreme liberals in Washington want to shut down U.S. energy, including through the so-called Green New Deal. Close your factories. Get rid of your cows. You dont have too many cows in Wildwood, but if you do, theyre gone. We will never sacrifice Americas energy independence. Took us a long time to get there, and we really picked it up over the last three years. What weve done is incredible, pipelines all over. Pipelines are good. Theyre underground, theyre good, environmentally sound. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most. These are the communities that really have suffered. We created, with the help of a great gentleman from the state of South Carolina, You know who Im talking about Tim Scott, right Senator Tim Scott, hes an incredible guy. He really is. He came to my office and he had this idea that hes wanted to do for a long time. Senator Tim Scott, opportunity zones, and jobs and investment are now pouring into nearly 170 newly designated opportunity zones right here in New Jersey, all over the United States. Billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and not government dollars, theyre flowing into the opportunities zones into areas where investment was dead. For decades, politicians ran for office promising to protect American workers, but then they went to Washington and they lined their pockets with special address cash, and they shipped American jobs and dreams to other countries. They closed up your factories. They got rid of your jobs. They didnt have to pay taxes. Globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob our factories, steal our farms and ransack our communities. Not anymore, not anymore, because we are defenseless no more because long last you have a President who puts America first. Is that okay The United States laws, listen to this number, and you know if it was wrong, the fake news would be all over me, and Ive been saying it for three years. The United States lost 60,000 factories and plants. Think of that. You wouldnt think thats possible because of stupid trade deals, because of bad leadership. During the 16 years of the two prior administrations, under just three years, my administration has now added 12,000 new factories, and many more are being built and theyre pouring back into the United States, because thats where the action is. Thats where they want to be. They are pouring back into our country, new plants and factories. You see them all over. I passed two of them coming in, brand new, beautiful plants and factories. Theyre pouring back in. This is where the action is. This is where they want to be. I see the leaders, they say, Its incredible what happened to your country. I said, Dont tell me that. We want you to have your companies build plants in New Jersey and other places, and thats whats happening. But on no issue have Washington Democrats thoroughly betrayed the American people than the issue of immigration. Left-wing, radical, politician support deadly sanctuary cities, and remember, a sanctuary city is a jurisdiction that refuses to hand over criminal aliens that are in local law enforcement custody. Instead, they order them to be released into your community. What the hell is going on What is going on Once set loose, these criminal aliens are free to continue their crimes spree against innocent Americans. Right here in New Jersey, your states Democrat leaders have instituted sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your community. For example, Cumberland County, we all know Cumberland County very well, right Good luck with this one. They released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child. He is now at large, free to search for another innocent victim. They didnt want to give him to ICE, and I want to thank ICE, because the abuse they take and the incredible job they do. Right here, another criminal alien was arrested for a violent assault in New Jersey. The sanctuary jurisdiction of Middlesex County defied the ICE request to detain him. Local authorities released him and he went on to commit a gruesome triple murder. I could read these cases, honestly, I could read and state these cases to you all night. I could state these cases to you all night. No American should ever be hurt, harmed or killed because left-wing politicians, Democrats, decided to shield and shelter Look, look, wait. You have criminals that are on the streets that should be in jail. You have criminals that on the street that should be taken the hell out of our country and brought back to where they came from. By the way, ICE has removed thousands upon thousands of MS-13 gang members, the most brutal people. You dont want to do that job. Maybe you do, a couple of tough people up there. Anybody want to be with ICE You got a lot of tough people in New Jersey. New Jersey is different. I think New Jersey is different. No, but these ICE people, they love our country. Theyre proud and theyre tough people, and theyll go right into a pack. They call it a pack and they start swinging. Everyones swinging or they end up standing up. Thats the end of that, and you know what they do They bring the MS-13 and many other gang members and other members back to El Salvador, back to Honduras, back to Guatemala, back to Mexico. I want to thank Mexico because you know whats happening, right Thousands and thousands at this moment, 27,000 soldiers from Mexico, protecting our Southern border. I want to thank the President. Democrats stand for crime, corruption and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order and justice, and say what you want, but those are the facts. We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members. We are literally taking them by so many, thousands and thousands, and were bringing him back. Thanks to our tireless efforts of border patrol to secure our border, we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row. We have the numbers down by 75% since spring, 75%. We have ended catch and release and really, look, I had another party. I could get anything. If I wanted to spend money on anything, look with the military, we got two trillion dollars, right More. Two trillion, all made in America, right Everything. Best planes, best missiles, best everything, made in America. If I wanted to build anything, the only thing they put the whole weight of their party, they didnt want us to have the wall. They knew it worked. Many of them voted five years ago for a wall. They just didnt know how to get it built. I do. But what happened is through a series of court cases and other things, the money has won, and we are now building that beautiful wall, and this powerful border wall is going up at record speed and we just reached over 100 miles of wall, and by next year, well be over 400 miles, and shortly thereafter it will be complete. A lot of people were saying a year ago, He didnt build the wall yet. He didnt build the wall. Let me tell you. When you have the strength of a party that has the House, okay, hopefully theyre not going to have the House for long. Well have a wonderful new speaker, will get rid of Nancy Pelosi, nervous Nancy, nervous Nancy. Well have Kevin McCarthy whos been fantastic. We have to win back the House. But think of this. The wall, so many people were saying, Build it. Well, its not easy when you have the weight of an entire party and they control the House, not easy. We did it and frankly we were building the wall through the help of the military, the Army Corps of Engineers anyway, but you know what Now we actually have the money and its going up very rapidly. In all due respect to Mexico, we like Mexico very much, and weve gotten along great with Mexico, and the Presidents a friend of mine, and I think hes doing a fantastic job. Its a tough situation. But Mexico is in fact, you will soon find out, paying for the wall. Okay Theyd hit you with that. Now the wall is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by Mexico, and its an advantage for Mexico, too, when you think about it. The wall is a vital barrier for blocking deadly drugs from pouring into these communities. What were doing is stopping drugs at a record number. Its still anything that comes over is too much, but were blocking it at a record number. Im also very proud to report that we won a critical Supreme Court victory yesterday on immigration. We will now be finally able to enforce federal law, and ensure that those seeking admission to our country are able to support themselves financially and not abuse taxpayer funded programs. They were killing our country, killing our country. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now. Frankly, theyre crazy. These people are crazy. Theyre taking their cues from socialists like Bernie. Left-wing lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of health care that would strip 180 million Americans of their private health care plans, which many people like. The plans of every Democrat running for President would demolish the economy of New Jersey, where half a million new New Jersey workers are employed at some of the best and most innovative health care employment companies. We have them working at the companies, and we have people getting great health care. Its been so long. Its finally working and they want to destroy it. The Republican party will never let it happen. We are saving your health care while the Democrats are trying to take away your health care, take away your doctors, take away all of the good care that we fought, and we fought hard, and were doing well and now were doing better. By the way, some time prior to the end of the year, were putting in for a new middle income tax cut, a very big one. But were making health care better and much, much cheaper. Weve done a great job in running it and weve given you a lot of alternatives. We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will, the Republican party, pre-existing conditions, we saved it. We are stopping surprise medical billing and making everything transparent. Thats a big deal, and that will take effect starting in about two months from now. Everythings transparent. Youll be able to see pricing. Youll be able to go and price other hospitals, other doctors. Its going to be an incredible thing. Nobody believes I was able to do it, but we did it. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and the plan of your choice. We are lowering drug prices. The Democrats are increasing drug prices. We are fighting the lobbyists and special interests. We are serving you and how are we doing Were doing good, right But because of price transparency, we are getting it done. Were approving more generic drugs than ever before in the history of our country. That means they come in, frankly, theyre just as good as the big names, but they sell for 80% less in some cases. We are unleashing innovation to cure diseases of all kinds. We are cutting out the rich middlemen and delivering prescription drugs directly to the consumers. These are all things that we had to fight like hell to get. Were making less paperwork for your doctors and giving you easy control of your medical records, which is a big deal for a lot of people. We are prohibiting hospitals from hiding their prices and charging hidden costs. You go home, you say, Oh, Im feeling better. The doctor was fantastic, and then they send you a bill for 25,000. Thats the end of that. All of a sudden the doctor wasnt so good, right We are making companies compete for your business. We are repealing burdensome taxes. We have accomplished more than any President in the first three years of their term by far, not even close. We have provided health insurance options, 60% cheaper than Obamacare, and we have historic investments in treating kidney disease, HIV, pediatric cancer and Alzheimers disease. Were making so much progress. We have just passed a thing that I think is great. I never understood. For 45 years, theyve been trying to get it passed. Weve just passed a thing called Right to Try. You know what that is So, we have the greatest doctors, the greatest technicians, the greatest labs in the world, and well have a drug thats looking good, but its going to take five more years, and by the way, weve brought the timing way down from 12 years to half of that, but it takes years to get it approved. You have people that are terminally ill. If they have money, they go to Asia, they go to Europe, they go all over the world looking for help. If they dont have money, they go home and they die. What we did is a thing called Right to Try. People sign something and they dont hold the country responsible. They dont hold the drug company responsible. Its called Right to Try, and they get the newest, and the best, and the latest medicine where its looking good, but youre not going to have it for five more years, and you know why they didnt do it Because they didnt want to hurt anybody, except the problem is the people were going to die soon. I said, Theyre terminally ill. Let them have it. We sat down with a great group of leaders, Republican leaders, and honestly, we had some bipartisan support and we got it done. Theyve been tried to do it for 45 or so years. We got it done. You have to see the results, and Ive seen some of the results. Some of the results are incredible. Weve transformed veterans health care, including through VA choice, right VA choice. For 48 years theyve been trying to get veterans choice. I thought I had the greatest secret. You know, I havent been doing this that long, so four years ago, Im campaigning for president. Everyone said, No, hes only having fun. Yeah, its some fun. This is a lot of fun. Right But for 45 years- But for 45 years theyve been trying to get it Veterans Choice. So I come back one day, I say to my people, I have the greatest idea. I am so smart. I am like the smart- I have an idea because the veterans are waiting online. Theyre waiting online for two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, ten weeks. Some are okay and they end up being terminally ill by the time they see the doctors, too long. And I said, Folks, I have the greatest idea. All of my people, I say, I have the greatest idea. Im so smart. Heres what were going to do. Were going to send all those people that cant see a doctor, we just cant get them to see a doctor. Were going to send them down the road to private doctors and were going to pay the bill and theyre going to get fixed up. Right So smart. But you see, I said I was smart and they looked back at me and they said, Sir, weve known about that concept for 45 years. We just cant get it approved. But I got it approved. And I got it approved about 11 months ago. And the VA is doing fantastically well. Our veterans are doing great. That was a big thing. That was a big thing. We also got accountability. Where people could mistreat our veterans, do whatever they want, they could be sadistic. They could be so many other things. They could steal, they could rob. You couldnt do anything, youd keep them. You couldnt do a thing. We got accountability. Now you look at him, you say, Get the hell out of here. Youre fired, youre fired. Now you can fire. Theyve let go of more than 8,000 bad people. We have reduced opioid deaths for the first time, and very substantially, in 30 years. And we are modernizing critical vaccines. Were doing a great job with vaccines. We are creating a pathway to buy drugs from Canada, that are much, much cheaper, in Florida. Governor Ron DeSantis came to me. He said, Sir, this system is so bad. And you cant fix it unless you have democrat votes, thats why you got to vote the house. You got to get us back the house. They say, Sir, we can buy the drugs in Canada for 50% less. The same drug made in the same factory, made by the same company. 50% and we can give the benefit for the people that live in Florida, or Colorado, or New Jersey, or wherever you are. This has been going on for a long time. No president has wanted to do it. You know how long it took me to make that decision I said, If you can say 50%, or 25%, or 15% buy it. Do it. Go. And I gave him authorization, Do it. We are protecting Medicare for our nations seniors. Democrats want, and you know this, Democrats want to raid Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants. And you know, we all have a heart. We all have a heart, but when you tell people to come into our country, like this clown governor of California, come into our country. Theyre all going to come. If they think theyre going to get free education, free healthcare, theyre all going to come. If you dont say it, theyre not going to come. Because who would even think this Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. Ripping babies straight from the mothers womb, right up until the moment of birth. And that is why Ive asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. Look at whats happening to their cities. Los Angeles, its so sad. What you see is so sad with the homeless and the way they dont take care of the homeless. San Francisco, starting in New York. You could take a look at whats happening to our cities run by Democrats. Its a disaster. They dont know what the hell theyre doing. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream. Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. Thats what it is. Its one of the greatest moments. Its probably the greatest movement in history. The 2016 election was probably, I mean you could say, the greatest election in the history of our country. And now we have to do it again to keep it going. Its like a giant tree, you plant it, but it takes time to grab on. We need this next election so badly. The good news is, its much easier, because here Ive done it all. Ive achieved more than I promised. I never told you about Space Force. We got Space Force. I never told you about all of these things that we got. We are a big tent party in the true idea. Its big ideas, and we have a big future together. This country has tremendous potential, if we dont blow it. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we pass bi-partisan, criminal justice reform. They came to me, they couldnt get it done, including many conservatives. And these people that I fight every day, they came to me, Help, help, help. Criminal justice reform. I got it done. As soon as I got it done, they dont even want to mention my name. I got it done. I got people to vote for it that they could have never gotten. President Obama tried, he couldnt get it done. President Bush couldnt get it. They couldnt get it done. Thats okay. They couldnt get it done. I got it done. I got it done. And after I got it done, and I mean solely got it done, and after I got it done they had news conferences. Theyre thanking people that I never even heard of. The only one they didnt think was President Trump. And I got it done, but thats the way it is. Thats why I always say you have to thank yourself because nobody else is going to do it. Were fighting to give school choice to every child in America who needs it. During National School Choice Week, we reaffirmed that no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school. School Choice, very important. Democrats dont want that. To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 191 brand new beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. And two great Supreme court justices, two great ones. As we rebuild our military, we have authorized over 160 million to support our warriors at a place called, huh, McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix. Have you ever heard of those places Have you ever heard of those places, New Jersey  160 million, two great places. I recognized Israels true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Nobody else was going to do it. Theyve been trying to do that one for 52 years. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of New Jersey. My friends. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. I really mean that, its the survival of our nation. And if you would have had the other party winning this last election, instead of your market being up 72%. Instead of your 401ks being up numbers that you cant even believe where your wife or your husband says, Darling, youre the most brilliant person in history. For years, youve been losing your ass with 401ks. Now youre making a fortune. Right Right Now youre making a fortune. I have people coming up to me all the time. I had one gentlemen come up, Sir. Thank you, sir. Youve made me look so smart. My wife never respected me for anything, not anything. But now she thinks Im a great investor. Thank you. 401k. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for it to secure, then we must devote everything that we have toward victory in 2020. We have to. And by the way, when we talk about inheriting victory in 2020 in our Nation, just so you understand, under a big tax cut biggest tax cut plan in history, guess what you have You have a business, you have a farm, you have a small business, no more inheritance tax, no more what we call death tax. So if you love your children, they wont have to mortgage the plant. They wont have to be mortgage the farm, as the expression goes. They wont have to mortgage anything, theres no tax. If you dont love your children, dont leave it to them and then you do have a problem. No, Im only kidding. Does anybody here not love their child or their children Because if you dont Theres one man raising his hand. Nah, thats a big thing. No more estate tax, no more death tax for your small farms and business. Those are things that people dont even realize. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. And I never even knew the swamp was this bad. Swamp is bad, bad people. A lot of bad people in the swamp. Bad people in the swamp you thought this was going to be easy, right A lot of bad people. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. Thats whats happening now. We will enact trade deals, the greatest deals ever made. That result in more product proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. Beautiful. For decades we had politicians that didnt care about that phrase. That phrase didnt mean anything to them. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine. Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic, can you believe this, in America in 10 years or less. Weve already started the process. And it could have been started sooner by the past administration, they chose not to do it. I chose to do it. Think of that, ending the AIDS epidemic within 10 years that weve started. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious Liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms, which is under seige. By the way, our second amendment is under siege. In Virginia, they want to take your guns away. Its just the beginning. Never going to happen as long as Im President of the United States. That I can tell you. But above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American ways. And we believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, In God, We Trust. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, very much, everybody. From Morristown to Vineland, and Patterson to Pennington. From Camden to Clifton, all the way down the shore to Ocean City and Sea Isle and Stone Harbor. And right here in Wildwood, New Jersey. This has always been the home of the proud, loyal, and very, very incredible Americans. And my friends, so many people in this group, I know them well. Theyre tough. Theyre smart, theyre great people. Its called Jersey. This is the state that pioneered the boardwalk, the diner, and the motion picture. And gave the world American greats like Thomas Edison and Frank Sinatra, old blue eyes. Frank Sinatra. He was a piece of work, that I can tell you. New Jersey is the state where George Washington led a die hard band of American patriots to victory at Trenton, and Princeton, and Monmouth. In our glorious battle to win American independence, George Washington. This is the state where generations of tough and strong New Jersey craftsmen and dock hands, farmers and factory workers built this country into the single greatest nation on the face of the earth. And we are making it greater and greater every day. It will never be better than whats coming. Therell never be anything like what were doing. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help and your devotion, with your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of New Jersey, place I love, the best is yet to come. Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. New Jersey. Thank you. Thank you."
Greenville,Jul17,2019,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to Greenville, North Carolina, I want to thank you. And to, Mike Pence, youve done a great job. Great Vice President. Thank you Mike. And we have all night, were going to have a lot of fun tonight, and I have nothing to do, nothing, nothing. We have nothing to do but make our country great again, and thats happening fast. Its wonderful to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of hardworking North Carolina patriots, and thank you for your support. Thank you for that very big victory we had three years ago. Time is flying. You getting ready Lets do it again. Right Lets do it again. I just heard that the United States House of Representative, has overwhelmingly voted to kill the most ridiculous project Ive ever been involved in, the resolution. How stupid is that Own impeachment. I want to thank those Democrats because many of them voted for us. The vote was a totally lopsided 332 to 95 to 1. 332 to 95, think of it, we have the strongest economy in history, the lowest unemployment numbers ever, weve rebuilt the most powerful military, it was totally depleted when I took office, and now its rebuilt. We passed the largest tax cuts and regulation cuts of any president or any administration in history. We took care of our great vets, including veterans choice, and veterans accountability. And they want to try and impeach, its a disgrace. Its a disgrace. So now we have that behind us, and I have to say this, and Ill say it just once, what happened to me with this witch hunt should never be allowed to happen to another president of the United States. Never, ever again. I want to thank Republican leadership for what theyve done for all of us, by stopping that hoax, the Russian hoax I call it, because America is winning again. Americas respected again, and, because we are finally putting America first. Our economic policy can be summed up in three very beautiful and simple words, jobs, jobs, jobs. Weve created 6 million new jobs since election day. If I would have said that, nobody would have believed it. If I wouldve said that, the fake news would have said hes exaggerating. And I wouldnt have said it because I wasnt even sure we could do it. Think of it, 6 million jobs since election day, think of it. And by the way, North Carolina has had its best economic year in the history of your state. Our country has added more than 180,000 people to the workforce, and think of that through what weve done on a federal basis. You picked up over 180,000 jobs, North Carolina. Think of that, and you have your lowest unemployment rate. You have a lot of good things, but lets not talk too much about North Carolina. Lets win this election nationwide. You remember North Carolina, that was going to be the Clinton firewall. She spent a fortune here, and I kept coming in and coming out. They call it, earned media. I earned it. I kept coming in and coming out, and every time I left they said, I dont think well lose in North Carolina. You know what I was right. We won it. We won it easily. We won it easily. So I just want to thank everybody. Seriously. This is a big that was a big deal. November 8th, that was a big deal. Donald Trump has won the great state of North Carolina. A big deal. That was when you started to see the folks at a certain other convention, beautiful looking place. One of the most beautiful venues Ive ever seen, but I dont want any part of it. It was unlucky. I dont want any part, but thats when you saw the people say, what the hell is going on What Whats happening And then it was state after state, it was Florida, it was South Carolina, we love South Carolina. Right Unbelievable. It was Pennsylvania. Remember they wouldnt announce the numbers in Pennsylvania, so there was 1% of the vote remaining. If I lost every one of those votes, we still win by a lot, and they wouldnt announce it. They wouldnt announce it. And then we won the great state of Wisconsin. First time in many, many decades, that a Republican won. And then we had a surprise, but not a surprise to us, because were bringing back the auto industry. We brought so much back to the great state of Michigan. That was a shocker, remember that Do you remember a certain hand on that beautiful board and they said, You know this sport is getting awfully red. Thats Republican. Theres a lot of red up there. We had a lot of That was one hell of a night, wasnt it though One hell of a night. I think it was maybe, you know there are those that say, one of the most extraordinary and exciting evenings in the history of television and the history of anything. And you know, you can go, all over the world in some cases, it was morning. You go to Asia, you go to Europe, you go all over. It was just record setting and heres the point, we have to do it again. We have to do it again. And the reason we have to not only to do new things, which we will, and you know statutorily and we had all sorts of artificial witch hunts over our head. Can you imagine if we didnt have to go through that hoax I dont know that we wouldve done any better to be honest with you. I think weve done more in two and a half years than any president ever first two and a half years. But could you imagine what it could have been if we didnt have the witch hunt You said it. He said it. I wont say it because its a Harrell, its a terrible word. So I will not say that this guy said, if we didnt have the bullshit, thats all. No, no. Could you imagine if we didnt have the time wasted the time and everything. Can you imagine And you know a friend of mine said maybe you wouldnt have done as well. Is that possible That can happen. Maybe we would have had too much time on our hands. Who knows But I can say, nobody in their first two and a half years has done anywhere close to what we not being what we, not me, what weve all done. Its true. The unemployment rate among African Americans is the lowest in the history of our country. Unemployment among Hispanic Americans, where were doing really well, you know why Because they want a strong border. They want it because they understand the border better than anybody. They want that strong border. They want that wall thats being built right now. They want that wall, and they really do. They understand the border better than anybody, and they dont want criminals coming in. They dont want crime coming, they dont want to lose their jobs. They like the fact that their salaries are going up, their wages are going up, they understand it better. So Hispanic American, the best unemployment numbers in our history, Asian Americans, the best unemployment numbers in our history. And likewise women, 74 years. So Im sorry women, I let you down. Its not in our history, but were going to be there very soon. Were going to be there very soon. Women are doing incredibly and women the men are going to get angry. Sorry men. Whoa, look at all those signs. Women for Trump. Wow, thank you. Thats a lot of signs. You remember last election, Donald Trump will never ever get the women. Then we got this tremendous number of women. We got this tremendous number of women, and during the election night, they say, Whats going on you know its called suppression polls. Suppression. Polls are just as fake as the news itself, but women filled 60%, and Im sorry to tell you this, men, theyre going to sue me for discrimination now. Women fill 60% of all of the new jobs created last year. Women took 60%, whats wrong with you, men Whats wrong with you But the radical Democrats are trying to destroy all of our countrys tremendous achievement, and our countrys tremendous success. Unprecedented. Weve had unprecedented success. Leaders come in from other countries, prime ministers, presidents, kings, queens, dictators. Sometimes, I hate to say it, dictators, and they all start off by saying, Mr. President, Id like to congratulate you on the incredible economy that youve created. The greatest anywhere in the world by far. And sadly, China who I have a very good relationship with President Xi, I really like him. But China has had yesterday it was announced, the worst year in 27 years. Weve had the best, and if our opponent ever got into office, instead of being up, 62% instead of those 401ks of yours being up 60, 70, 80, 90%, crash, big crash. You would have had a crash, the likes of which we have never seen before, if they got in office. Because we freed up our country, we freed up our economy especially with regulation cuts, but also with those big beautiful tax cuts. We freed it up. The leading voices of the Democrat Party are left wing extremists, who reject everything our nation stands for. But again, I have to tell you, this vote was so big. I have to thank many of the Democrats. I mean, that was amazing. No, no, I really do. I respect it. I really do. That was a slaughter, but many of those people that voted for us this afternoon in somewhat of a sneak attack, a real sneak attack, many of those people that voted for us were Democrats, and I want to thank them, because they did the right thing for our country. Republicans know that America is the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of our world. But these left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force of evil. The way they speak, so badly of our country. They want to demolish our constitution, weaken our military, eliminate the values that built this magnificent country. You have to look at some of their recent comments which are never talked about. When you see the four Congress women. Oh, isnt that lovely Ill give you just a couple, Ive had pages and pages, but we dont want to bore you. We dont want to go too long. But we have to give a couple, because thats the great thing about live television. They cant cut it. Representative Ilhan Omar, of a really great state, I almost won the first time in decades and decades, Minnesota. Greg Stanton. By the way, I keep hearing how much enthusiasm is in the radical left. I dont think they have enthusiasm. Theyre just fighting with each other. We have all of the enthusiasm. He goes home now to mommy, and he gets reprimanded, and thats the end. Sorry mommy. Sorry mom. Didnt mean to embarrass your mom. But its true, we have the enthusiasm folks. Look at this. Look at this. And by the way, thousands and thousands of people outside and people that couldnt get in, thousand. Weve got all the enthusiasm. Theyre fighting each other. Theyve gone so far left, nobody wants to even think about it. So representative Omar, blames the United States, for the terrorist attacks on our country, saying that terrorism is a reaction to our involvement in other peoples affairs. She smeared US Service members involved in Black Hawk Down. In other words, she slandered the brave Americans who were trying to keep peace in Somalia. Omar minimized the September 11th attacks on our homeland, saying some people did something. I dont think so. Some people did something. Yeah, some people did something. All right. She pleaded for compassion for Isis recruits attempting to join the terrorist organization. She was looking for compassion. Omar laughed that Americans speak of Al-Qaeda in a menacing tone and remark that, you dont say America with this intensity. You say, Al-Qaeda makes you proud. Al-Qaeda makes you proud. You dont speak that way about America. And at a press conference just this week when asked whether she supported Al-Qaeda, thats our enemy. Thats our enemy. They are a very serious problem that we take care of, but they always seem to come along somewhere. She refused to answer. She didnt want to give an answer to that question. Omar blamed the United States for the crisis in Venezuela. I mean think of that one, and she looks down with contempt on the hardworking American, saying that ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country. And obviously and importantly, Omar has a history of launching vicious antisemitic screens. When she talked about the evil Israel, and its all about the benjamins. Not a good thing to say. So thats Omar. Thats Omar. And by the way, many other things, all you have to do is press the right button on your beautiful screen, and youll see thing after You didnt hear this over the last two days or did you hear anybody talk about this Her colleague Representative Rashida Tlaib, agreed with Omars characterization of 9/11 and said that members of Congress who support Israel forgot, what country they represent. And Tlaib also used the F word to describe the presidency and your president. Thats not nice, even for me. She was describing the President of the United States and the presidency with the big fat vicious, the way she said it, vicious F-word. Thats not somebody that loves our country. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Check out her scores by the way, with her green new deal, the green new deal. Where did that come from Shes conducted outrageous attacks against men and women of law enforcement, she compared American border agents managing a humanitarian crisis, that I always said was a humanitarian crisis, and they said it was manufactured. They dont say it was manufactured, and were stopping it and I want to thank Mexico. Theyve got 21,000 soldiers now stopping people from coming into our country. But Cortez, somebody said thats not her name its They said thats not her name, sir. I said, No, no, I dont have time to go with three different names. Well call her Cortez. Too much time. Takes too much time. So Cortez also, she said essentially Nazis are running concentration camps, and when Mike Pence went down just a few days ago with members of Congress and the media, and you looked at those so-called horrible concentration camps, they said, Wow, these places a clean. Wow. They have air conditioning, they have water. And you know, to be honest, its not like they came and we want to take care of people. We got to straighten out our immigration laws. You know, in a very short period of time, if the Democrats would give us a few votes, we could solve the immigration problem and it would be so great. It would be so great. But these kids and these people come from rough places. And Ill tell you what, some of them said, Weve never lived like this before. They have water, they have air conditioning, they have things that theyve never seen. And we listen to her talking about drinking water from toilets, which was a lie, which was a lie. Cortez said that illegal immigrants are more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be, can you believe that Thats what she say. She described contemporary America, thats you, thats me, thats all of us, as garbage, garbage, a garbage. Remember deplorables, right That sounds worse. I think thats worse, but well save it for whoevers going to be the nominee, and right now, sleepy Joes not looking too good, Pocahontas. Pocahontas is gaining a little bit, because we probably use the Pocahontas a little bit too early, but thats okay. Well bring it out of retirement very soon. They have a new one who knocked the hell out of Biden during the debate He said, I wasnt prepared for that question. Thats not a good answer. Can you imagine And according to the polls, I won every single debate Republican and against Hillary. Can you imagine Those are the polls. They wont admit that. Many, many polls. But can you imagine if I said, Uh-oh, Im sorry I wasnt prepared for that question. Im gone. Thats the end of Trump. Hes not prepared. Hes not mentally prepared, thats his problem. But everybody that knows him knows that. But no Harris hit him with the pretty easy question on busing. What I would say thats pretty easy, and he choked. He choked. And then he said, Ah, yeah, Im sorry I ran out of time. I ran out of time He ran out of time. And then you have a young guy, Buttigieg, Buttigieg. Theyre saying how to say his name, Buut-ih-jij. Hes a beauty. He runs a failed city. His city is doing so badly. Mike Pence was the governor of that state. I said, How was he as the mayor Mike is one of the nicest human beings youll ever meet. And Mike said, he never did a good job, Im so shocked to see him running. Okay. And then he goes back home, and African Americans literally were so angry at him for the lousy job and hes supposed to be like a hot young star, if thats a hot young star, I guess I just dont no star anymore. That is not as star. Thats not a star. Buut-ih-jij, you say, Buut, and then add ih-jij, Buttigieg. I dont see him dealing with President Xi of China. I dont see him meeting successfully with Kim Jong-un. I dont see him dealing, and nobody has been tougher with Russia than Donald Trump. I dont know see him dealing with Vladimir Putin. And we have good relationships with them and many others, except now were no longer the suckers. Like with NATO, we protect Europe. We spent hundreds of billions of dollars and theyre not paying their fair share. So last year I went and said, Folks, sorry, you got to pay your fair share. 16 years was going like this The contribution, and now its like a rocket ship, 100 billion. I said to him, great people, 28 nations, including the US, I said to him, Listen, were taking care of you. You screw us on trade, and you dont pay your military bills. This is not a good deal for the United States. So were taking care of trade. We want to do it nice and slow and easy. You know, we got a world balance, but European Union is terrible to us on trade, terrible. Frankly, theyre as tough or tougher than China, just smaller in numbers. Thats the only difference. With China, 507 billion dollars, a you look over the years, for many, many years, theyve been taken. And guys like Biden say, Uh-oh, Wed them them. And he was there eight years, Wed stop that. No, Trump is stopping it. Trump is stopping it. Representative Ayanna Pressle. Is she related in any way to Elvis I dont know. Who knows You never know. She thinks that people with the same skin color, all need to think the same or military. You know theyre attacking a single man standing there with a camera, who never got hit and never hit back before in his life that. Theyre very brave. They always show up with a mask and theyre covered. Because then they go home to mom and dad. They dont want mom and dad to know where they were. But they always attract people that really cant defend themselves very well. Right Theyre attacking this group. Theyre not attack North Carolina. Thats for sure. So these Congresswomen, their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left, but thats so, they are very evil. Theyre hitting people over the head with sticks, and I mean sticks. I mean bats even, theyre whacking people with bats. Theyre very brave. They always show up with a mask and theyre covered, because then they go home to mom and dad. They dont want mom and dad to know where they were. But they always attract people that really cant defend themselves very well. Right Theyre attacking this group. Theyre not attack North Carolina. Thats for sure. So these Congresswomen, their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left, but thats okay, because were going to win this election like nobodys ever seen before. And tonight I have a suggestion for the hate filled extremists, who are constantly trying to tear our country down. They never have anything good to say. Thats why I say, Hey, if they dont like it, let them leave. Let them leave. Let them leave. Let them leave. Theyre always telling us how to run it, how to do this, how to the you know what if they dont love it, tell them to leave it. I dont know. And Ill watch, Ill go back to the, Oh sir, that was so controversial, sir. No, Im just saying its their choice. They can come back when they want, but you know, they dont love our country, I think in some cases they hate our country. And its so angry, even yesterday they went on the stage. I said, Let me watch this. And the anger, they were trying to be nice, but its hard. Its hard for them to do that. That choice for every American has never been more clear. Thats true. The Democrat agenda is anti worker, anti jobs, anti citizen anti-family and anti common sense. With the exception of all of those Democrats that voted for us today, well give them up, okay Theyre fine, theyre fine. They are fine and youll lose to them, its different. Its okay. Its called normal political back and forth. But I want to tell you something, the Democrats are being violent, so vicious, moving so far left, its out of control. Its out of control. The Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100% pro-American. So were thrilled tonight to be joined by several North Carolina Republican leaders. Really great people. Theyve been so helpful to me and theyre doing an incredible job. Lieutenant Governor, Dan Forest, Lieutenant Governor. North Carolina, Treasurer Dale Folwell. Greenville Mayor, PJ Connelly, I hear he does a good job, PJ. And North Carolina GOP Chair, Michael Whatley incredible NCAA wrestling champion, great guy. He wanted to stay back. I said, You sure you dont want to come I do want to come, but I really want you to win today, if you dont mind. I said, Okay, you better stay back. If I see you here Im going to be very angry. And they did their job, didnt they This man is from the great state of Ohio, Congressman Jim Jordan. Were going to do this quickly, but its just important that you get out and vote, theyre two great people. I want to introduce the next member of Congress from North Carolinas third congressional district, just won a great race, Dr. Greg Murphy. Greg is a winner. So you know Greg would be great on jobs, all the things you want, tough on crime, strong on borders, pushing the wall, hell be pushing it like nobody. Were building the wall but were pushing it. Its like pulling teeth. Weve got six lawsuits on the wall, weve won two of them, were going to win others. But you think its easy, dont you folks, you think this is easy But were building a lot of wall and we hope if we can win that final one, its so important its going before the Supreme Court, well have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. So go out, get Greg elected. Great victory, by the way, that was a great primary and a great victory. That same day theres another crucial election in North Carolinas 9th Right, you know what were talking about 9th, I know its not here, but its very close, right 9th Congressional district. The Democrat in the race is an ultra liberal named Dan McCready, he wants to take away your guns, he wants to raise you taxes, he doesnt care about borders, he likes open borders. And he really admires socialism, I dont think that works too well in North Carolina. Doesnt work too well in our country. Were joined tonight by the Republican candidate who is really a special man, a great man, hes going to be a great, great Congressman, Dan Bishop. Dan Thank you, Dan. Thank you Dan. And he will indeed defend your values, your family, and he will always defend our second amendment unlike the opponents. Theyre really into destroying our second amendment. Whove been violently operating for more than 10 years, we got them all, we think they are no good. With conducting brutal, medieval style killings, you know what medieval style is Okay. Little pieces, little pieces, little pieces, medieval style, including the dismemberment of their victims, and they enjoyed every minute of it. These are sick people. When I call them animals, Nancy Pelosi said, How dare he used that name These are human beings. I dont think theyre human beings. Most of those indicted were in our country illegally, 19 to be exact, 19 of 22. Think of that, they want to protect These are savage beasts, these are savage killers, and they shouldve been brought out a long time ago by the Obama administration. Were bringing MS-13 out by the thousands, getting them the hell out of our county. And when you read about deportation and Sunday, weve got a lot of people on Sunday, but we have a lot of people and were always shooting for the bad ones first. Which makes sense, right, but when you hear about that, we always want to get And by the way, do you know how dangerous it is for these ICE agents, these ICE and border patrol But ICE, they go into a nest, they call it a nest, a nest of these killers. Theyre tough, theyre smart, and you know what, theyre great patriots, they love our country. The danger that they have is incredible. And I just want to salute and I have to tell you, I want to salute ICE and border patrol, and I want to support and salute law enforcement in the United States. These are great people. These are great people and they dont get the credit that they deserve, but you know what I tell them all the time, you have no idea how much the American people, the American public, you have no idea how much they love you and respect you, law enforcement. In the recent democratic debate, every single candidate, everyone, Biden was a little bit slower with the hand, it didnt work so well. They raised their hand in favor of giving free government healthcare. They raised their hand in giving a lot of other things that I dont think youre going to be happy with, illegal aliens will be very nicely covered. How about California, they just approved a 100 million They just approved 100 million to take care of the needs of illegal immigrants, and then you look on the sidewalks of Los Angeles, the sidewalks of San Francisco, Nancy Pelosis district, nobodys ever seen anything like it in the history of our country whats happening there. So if you dont want Democrats to raid your healthcare, to steal away your money, to bankrupt your country, then you have a choice, you must vote Republican. All American citizens, including millions and millions of legal immigrants who work hard to come into our country, who study, who wait on line sometimes for 10 years, and who respect our laws and follow the rules, they deserve a government that is loyal to them. They work hard. You cant say you love our country if you want to destroy it through open borders, open borders are a disaster. Human trafficking, the first time I heard as a politician, human trafficking, nobody talks about it, it sounded almost like an ancient crime, many, many years ago, hundreds of years, thousands of years ago, human trafficking, its the worst now throughout the world because of the Internet, its the worst its ever been. And the worst treated of all, children, but its women, women, the Democrats want to do nothing about it. Human trafficking is worse than it ever has been in the history of the world, not just This is not a United States problem, this is all over the world. Human trafficking, its a terrible, terrible thing and we got to solve it. Most of it comes through, in this country, our southern border where we dont have the wall. Theyre not going through our points, theyre not going through areas where we have security, where we have guards, where we have gates, where we have all sorts of equipment, no, they ride through the desert and they make a left where you dont have the wall. Its so simple, everybody knows it. The Democrats all know it because five years ago before I was here, they all wanted it. Now they dont want it, you know why they dont want it For political reasons, and you know what, its going to cost them a lot of points in the election, I think probably cost them the election itself. Just lastly, Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities which release violent criminal aliens onto our streets. Where we just picked up these 22 thugs, these 22 monsters, we just picked him up in, where, Los Angeles. Sanctuary city, wonderful sanctuary city. Thom Tillis senator recently introduced a bill to give American victims the right to pursue sanctuary cities and hold them accountable for the thousands of lives they have shattered, theyve shattered these lives. Thank you very much Thom. Every nation has the right to establish and enforce immigration rules in its national interest, its very simple, isnt it Its common sense, its so simple and the voters understand that. We expect that those who seek to join our society will obey our laws, revere our constitution, cherish our history, support themselves financially, and embrace our American values and love our American flag. We believe in an immigration system based on merit, merit, where they come in. We have so many companies coming in, automobile companies, companies of all types, and we need workers. We actually need workers. We have the lowest unemployment rate that weve had in 51 years, soon itll be the lowest ever. We need workers, but they have to come in where they can help our country. They have to come in based on merit, and were putting in bills and lets see what happens. Otherwise, well just wait til we win back the house, win the Senate, win the Presidency, and well vote. Democrats have never been farther outside of the mainstream. Theyre going crazy folks, theyre going crazy. More than 130 Democrats in Congress have signed up for Bernie Sanders total government takeover of healthcare, isnt that nice This is one of the great It wont happen, he knows that. The guy never passed the bill, he did nothing. Hes actually not even a Democrat, isnt he an independent I dont know, hes running but He missed his time. Hey Bernie, let me save you a lot of time and effort, Bernie, you missed your time. It got taken from you four years ago, Bernie. Not doing too well. Hes not doing too well, but thats okay. I got to hand it to him hes up there ranting and raving and going like a lunatic. I said to our first lady the other day, I was watching Bernie and hes screaming, his hairs all crazy, Im going to do this, Im going to do that, no more college loans, no more cost for anything. Nothing, youre not going to pay for anything. Hes desperate now, hes desperate. You dont have to pay for anything. I joke, I said, And everybody will get a free Rolls-Royce, every family gets a free Rolls-Royce, every family. And the media said, Donald Trump is exaggerating. He knows that theyre not getting a Rolls-Royce. Im sorry, dont put it. Dont put that I said Free Rolls Royce. But Bernies desperate now, I watch him up there its a sad situation. But I think theyre all sad when you get right down to it. For instance, were in this incredible state North Carolina, that you have your best economy that youve ever had. Forget the country for a second, you have the best economy youve ever had, you have your best unemployment numbers, you had the most people working than at any time in the history of your state, you have your best black unemployment numbers, best Hispanic unemployment numbers, best women unemployment numbers, best Asian unemployment numbers. Whoever the opponent is, what are they going to do is just say, North Carolina, Im going to do a great job. You have the best numbers in the history of our country in your state, so I dont know, and we won by a lot. And we won by a lot I was telling Mike, I was telling my son Eric Trump and Laras here, y the way, who was born in North Carolina. They do a good job. Lara, do you love this state And her brothers here, I have to tell you, he went to this college. And Brad Parscale is here, the worlds tallest campaign manager in the history of the world. Hes the tallest in the history, but most importantly, hes the best. The worlds tallest manager but hes the best manager. Thank you, Brad. Great job. And he just told me our poll numbers are through the roof, he just told me that so Ill take that. We are a year and a half away, but were doing well, you see it. Youd know, youd be the first to know. Number one, you wouldnt be here, you wouldnt be here. We havent had an empty seat in any event, I dont believe, that weve ever been to, I dont think weve ever had we always have people, we havent had an empty seat. You look anywhere, North Carolina, Ohio, no matter where we go we pack it and we have thousands and thousands of people, we put screens outside. I know tonights not so good, we got a hundred degrees out, but you still have thousands of people out there. We could have sold this arena out, you know that. We could have sold this arena out tonight 10 times, can you believe that 10 times. I think thats like a poll, thats like a poll because when Biden goes out I see Sleepy Joe and he says, They had 115 people show up, 115 people. Thats our first row. The democratic record on healthcare is one of deception and destruction, the last administration said a lie. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, 28 times, a total lie. My administration is defending your sacred right to choose the doctor and the plan that you want, and we are offering plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare, and a lot of people are starting to figure that out. Better healthcare. And well also always protect You have to remember this, you ready, because they give us a bum rap. Patients with preexisting conditions are protected by Republicans much more so than protected by Democrats who will never be able to pull it off. Preexisting conditions, and you know, the job weve done on healthcare, its not talked about, but were also doing something. Its been phenomenal, we have 180 million people right now really happy on private plans, and you know what, theyre going to be taken away. Under the Democrats plan all of those people that are thrilled where they went out and negotiated cross state lines, all of the things they did, they went out, negotiated great private plans, its all going to be taken away from you under this plan. Now, I only hope they dont change because were talking too soon, we got a year and a half left. Its like when I called Pocahontas, Pocahontas, I shouldve waited six months because she then went out and got that test. 1024th, and Ive always said I have more Indian blood in me than she has in her, and I have none. I have none, but its more than she has, 1024. I brought it up too soon so I dont talk about it anymore, but if she should be the candidate, which I tend to doubt, but if she should be well bring it up again and I think it will be very successful. 1024, how about this, I was driving her crazy, so she went out and hired a guy to check the blood. Im sure he had a lot of fun doing that. He checked her blood and found out that many, many, many, many, many, many years ago, there could have been somebody and he could have been Indian. And then the Indians got together and they said, We dont want her. We want Trump, we want Trump, they want Trump. Weve taken historic action to fight the opioid epidemic, what a problem, and just today it was just announced before I came in, that drug overdose deaths were working so hard on this, including our vice president, including our first lady, including everybody in the Trump administration, its dropped for the first time in more than 30 years, its gone down. First time, it was a big problem. And in North Carolina and were far from finished, its a big problem, it declined 8% last year. Thats a lot because it was just going up like a rocket. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb right up until the moment of birth. Well then you have the gentleman from our governor from Virginia, so were talking about late term, hes talking about the baby is born before the mother makes the decision. Thats the first Ive heard of it, thats the first most of you have heard of it, and then they pass legislation in various states saying thats okay. This is a baby thats born, this isnt late term. This is a baby thats born. Nobodys ever heard anything like that, nobodys ever seen anything like it. Nobodys ever seen anything like it. And that actually, when he had the scandal, that became, can you believe it The second biggest story. Can you believe that, how important it is and yet that was the second biggest story, and what a shame when thats the second biggest story. What happened to our values Republicans believe that every life is a sacred gift of God. Thats why Ive asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion of babies. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion intolerance and division. The Republican Party is the party for all Americans and American values. We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream. This is the proud banner the Republican Party will carry into the Republican National Convention next summer in the great city of Charlotte, North Carolina. Dont disappoint me, that should be good for at least 10 points, right These are some of the greatest ladies, I see them in Ohio, and Florida. We love you too, thank you, really. How many have you been to, just out of curiosity Whats the number All but two, Ive done hundreds of them. And then they say women dont like Trump, I think they do. Now I see them, theyre great. Great ladies, youre great. Its interesting with women, so women want to have a strong military protection, they want to have strong borders, they want to have strong law enforcement, they want to have great education, they want to have low taxes for their family, not high taxes. They want to have all the things that we talk about, why wouldnt they want Trump more than anybody else The other side is going to go the opposite. And they did in the last election, and were doing a lot better. The difference is, the last election I was a successful businessman running for president, I said I was going to do things. And by the way, really successful. Im going to show you something someday soon, Im going to show you something. They say he was really successful, he wasnt successful, hes really smart, or hes really stupid but hes trying to take over the world. They have so many messages, hes really stupid, then next week, Donald Trump has a sinister plot to take over the world, he cant be too stupid, because they actually think its working. I saw one of these so-called comedians the other day and hes a pretty respected comedian, he said, hes not leaving. Im telling you, hes not leaving, hell never live. Hell win this election and in 24, Im telling you, hes not leaving. Hes going to stay. So we did through our friend Dan Scavino, we did a Time Magazine cover. I was on so many times, I dont even read this thing, and it says, Trump, 2014, 2018. But it says 20 heres where we go, we start at 16, we go to 20, we go to 24, did you see it Then it says 28, 32, 36, 40, 42. No, we dont need any more time. We dont need any more time, we need one more. A senator came to my office, sir, Im six foot seven, Im great. Im six foot seven so I can give you great advice. I said, Senator, Im one for one but it happened to be the president. And now I want to be two for two, two for two. Two for two, so we have 16, we have 20, we have 24, and you know whats very interesting though They were really people out there think Im not leaving, can you believe it Hey, maybe that is a good idea, lets think about it. Watch, you want to drive them crazy, theyre going to go crazy. All I have to do is say, Lets think about it. Theyre going to go crazy. No, I promise 2024, I leave. By that time, just so you know, by that time our country will be so well seated, it will be so strong like never, ever, in our history. But everything that we built, low taxes, strong military, taking care of our vets, all of the things weve done can be decimated very quickly if the wrong person gets in especially now. Ive always said 2016 was the most important election maybe in the history of our country, a lot of people felt that. So I dont know, I cant say this is more important, what we did was a miracle. Not to us it wasnt, but a lot of people said it was the greatest election weve ever had. Theres never been anything like it, never been such excitement. Never been such excitement. But you know what, if we dont win in 2020 everything that weve done, seriously though, everything that weve done, your 401s are going to crash, the whole thing, its going to come down like a stack of cards. So, in a certain way, lets say this is of equal importance, by that time well have values instilled, well have free enterprise instilled, people are working now. We have the lowest food stamps that weve had in many years, lowest food stamps because people are working. So I really think its at least equal, its equal, maybe its a little less, who the hell knows I just know this, it can disappear very, very quickly. We have to get out, we have to vote. Thats why Im starting early, can you believe it We have less I see all these clowns on television I say I guess we have to counteract them a little bit, but this is not what you want running, none of them, this is not what you want running this incredible country of ours. Every day we make good on the motto, promises made, promises kept. Ive had people back there that dont like me and somebody said, very nicely, that hes actually made certain promises and hes actually kept more promises than hes made. Its true. Ive done things that I never I never said we were going to get, as an example with our vets, that we going to get, Joyce, that we were going to have the ability to fire people that dont treat our vets properly. We can fire them now. Theyve been trying to get that for 44 years, Joyce had been trying to get practically from the beginning, Joyces so simple and yet they never got it, nobody got it through. Were good at getting things through. Weve done more than we said we would. A man I know, who I dont like, a businessman, very, very, very successful, one of the most successful but I dont like him, never liked him. He never liked me, by the way. In fact, I would go a step further, he cannot stand me. And I saw him about two months ago and he came up to me, I said, How are you doing Very warm, hey, how you doing Lets get out of here. And he said, Im doing good, youre doing good I said, Yeah. I said, You dont like me, and I dont like you. I never have liked you, and you never have liked me, but youre going to support me because youre a rich guy. And if you dont support me youre going to be so goddamn poor youre not going to believe it. And he said to me, Mr. President. He calls me Mr. President, everybody calls me Mr. President, its true, its a funny thing. He said, Mr. President, youre right, Im supporting you, I think youre doing a great job. And maybe we didnt get along. But its not like he has a choice, he has no choice. And on top of that, its a good choice because weve done the right thing. And it is funny with the name Mr. President, I have friends, really good friends, and theyve always called me Don, Donald, D, they call me anything, and you lose all your friends when youre president because theyre all afraid to talk to you, does that make sense No, its true. Except for these six, seven, ladies up here, they always talk. Theyre not intimidated. No, its true, I have guys, I have wonderful friends, New York developers, tough guys, smart guys, theyre rich, theyre this, that. I have middle of the road, I have poor, I have everybody. I have poor guys, middle of the road, and rich guys, doesnt matter. Rich guys call up, Mr. President, how are you sir Its Richard. Oh, good, Rich, hey Richard, loosen up. This is a guy who used to, Hey Don, how you doing Lets go to dinner. Now youre, Sir, is everything youre doing good, sir. I said, Richard, call me Donald like you always did, call me Donald. Always call me Donald. Okay, thank you Donald, thank you very much. And then two minutes later, Mr President, its been so great to I lost all my friends. Theyve tightened up, theyve choked. You know what that is, they choked. They cant breathe because people have such respect for the office of the presidency, they have respect for the office of the president. They have respect for our country again, our country is respected again. Weve confirmed more than 125 federal judges to apply the law as written, including two supreme court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Weve launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, and last year, Im so proud of this because we have no help from the Democrats. Last year, for the first time in over 50 years, drug prices went down. And that was for a reason. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed groundbreaking, criminal justice reform. Its a big thing, prisoners theyve gotten out of jail and they never had an economy like this. We did a lot of things, because they get out jail they dont have a chance. They always go back, most of the time. Now theyre coming out and we have programs, but most of all we have this great economy where people are hiring prisoners, and you have to see the reviews theyre getting, they getting phenomenal reviews. Its a beautiful thing, its a beautiful thing whats happening with prisoners, they get out and they can actually get a job and thats whats happening and were very proud of them. Were expanding opportunities zone so that no American is left behind, its one of the great successes the opportunity zones. Nobody talks about it, its one of the great successes. And thanks to our pledge to Americas workers, private sector partners will provide apprenticeships and job training to 9 million Americans, isnt that nice Whenever I hear that word apprentice, I say I love that word, that was a good show. They figured, you know what well do, well get Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place, that didnt work out too well. That didnt work out too well, we had 14 seasons, think of that, The Apprentice. Ive proudly signed for bi-partisan human trafficking laws securing 400 million dollars to support victims of human trafficking. And we have secured, soon to be three years, record funding for our military. We want to cut budgets, but this is beyond budget. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided, disgusting Iran nuclear deal, and Iran is a different country today than it was. My administration proudly recognized the true capitol of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. That was some day, they all said, Many, many presidents have said, Were going to do it. Then they never did. I know why, because the pressure on them was enormous not to do it. And then on top of it, a couple of months ago, I just approved the Golan Heights for Israel. The Golan Heights, another thing. 52 years they tried to do that, they didnt get it done, so were doing good. We also recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and we condemn those that want to stop freedom in that country and other countries. Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country, will never, ever, be a socialist country, it just wont happen. A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream. Frankly, the destruction of our country, thats whats going to happen. Take a look around, their party is afflicted with an ideological sickness that protects foreign borders, but refuses to protect our own borders. Think of it, they fight all over though a lot of those people are coming back home folks, theyre coming back home a lot. We defeated ISIS, the Caliphate in Syria, were bringing our soldiers back home. ISIS does not like me too much, but I came here and it was a mess. It was a mess. I met with generals, general believe it or not, one general, his name is Raisin. I said, Whats your name Sir. This guys like out of a movie. Watch, hes going to be famous after this but who cares Whats your name And he goes, Sir, my name is Raisin. I said, Raisin, like you mean a little raisin. Yes sir, its my name, thats what they call me. Whats your last name Kane. I said, You mean your name is Raisin Kane I said, Raisin Kane, youre my kind of general. Let me talk to you Raisin Kane, get over here. And my previous general said, Its going to be a long time before we take out the caliphate. I said, did Raisin Kane and a couple of other generals that were there, these guys are central casting like from a movie, except better. Theyre stronger, bigger, tougher, meaner, and actually better looking in a certain way. But theyre like from a movie, there is nobody in Hollywood plays a role like this. I said, Generals, Ive been told its going take a year, two years, to get a 100%. Remember I want to pull them out, were down to 1%, and everyone went crazy, explain that one. But they said it was going to take a long time. I said to Raisin Kane and the other generals, General, how long can it take They said, Sir, one month. I said, What Were going to hit them from the front, were going to hit them from the back, were going to hit them from the, sir, were going to hit them like they never got hit before, we were never allowed to do this. And were not just going to hit them from our temporary base in Syria, sir, were going to hit him from Iraq, were going to hit them from places that they never knew existed, sir. Theyll be hit so Goddamn hard sir, they will be Thank you very much. Very shortly, very, very shortly, it was over, we had a 100% of the Caliphate, and these people were screwing around for years. Obama, President Obama. My generals did a great job, I flew there, I flew to Iraq, remember Im an Air Force One and they notified me, Sir, were 45 minutes out, sir. We have to close all windows, we have to turn off all lights in the plane, sir. All windows, all lights have to be off, sir. Were turning off the lights outside and the runway light, sir. They going to be in a very dim Frankly, if youre not at 30-year old pilot you cant see them, because I went there, I said, I dont see any light pilot. As were landing, I said, I dont see. And then I thought to myself, think of it, weve spent almost 8 trillion in the Middle East and we got to turn off the lights of an airplane to land, how bad is that They didnt do their job. We did our job, and the military did their job. But we fight to short of just keep going, we dont fight to win, I fight to win. I fight to win. So we land in this big, beautiful Air Force One and Im saying, Major, I dont see a runway. Yes sir, its right up ahead, the guys 30 years old or something. Theyll get me that, theyll say majors arent 30, maybe hes 35 whatever he is. Theyre saying, Yes sir, its right there. I dont see it major, how about lifting up, lets go around. Thats the last thing we want to do in that part of the world. He said, Sir, its right there, sir. And were landing and I still havent seen a light. But these guys, we have the greatest pilots in the world, we have the greatest military in the world, we have the greatest equipment in the world. So you must never forget the 2020 election is all about one thing, you. Its about you. Its about your family, its about your future, and the fate of your beautiful, loving, country, and thats what it is. We begin our North Carolina campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nations future. We love our nation, our nation is great today. Its going to be much greater, every year its getting better, and better. We have turned this big, beautiful, mighty ship, we have turned it around, its getting better, better, better. Together we will continue on unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can know the dignity of work and the pride of a paycheck positive vision for our nations future. We love our nation, our nation is great today. Its going to be much greater, every year its getting better, and better. We have turned this big, beautiful, mighty ship, we have turned it around. Its getting better, better, better. Together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can know the dignity of work and the pride of a paycheck. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress, those great gentlemen that just left the stage. To create a safe, modern, fair and lawful system of immigration, we will enact trade deals and they are going like you wont even believe. That doesnt mean the other countries are thrilled with me, there was a recent poll, Germany likes Obama better than Trump. A lot better. I said, Of course, because Im making them pay their bills. Im saying you got to pay. I say, Anguilla, Anguilla, you got to pay, Anguilla. Obama would go in, make a speech, leave. I go in and make a speech, I say, Let me speak to Anguilla. Anguilla you got to pay your bills, youre way behind. So I would think that they should, they should all like When you hear they like me better, Im not doing my job. Its true, Im not doing my job. They did a poll on one of these networks, and they would say, Donald Trump is not liked in Europe nearly as much as President Obama. I said, Or President Bush, or anybody. In fact Im disliked, but actually they respect us, thats more important. Look at that beautiful baby, look at that beautiful baby. Wow, what a baby What a baby That is a beautiful baby. Thats like from an advertisement, perfect. Look how happy that baby is, so beautiful. Thank you darling, thats really nice. Its a great thing, is that your husband Thats a great thing, thank you. Congratulations husband. What a picture But were going to have the country all set for your child, okay Awesome, because thats what its about. Now the media will say thats a prop, they say no baby is so beautiful. That had to be a set up. I never saw that guy in my life, which is true. Thank you. Good luck. Thank you very much. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words, made in America, made in the USA, either one is okay with me. Keep America great, thats right. We will give school choice to millions of underserved children who are trapped in failing government schools. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Theyre going to take your guns away. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one great nation, as one America. Its one America. We believe in the American constitution and we believe in the rule of law, we believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children, like your child, should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, In God we trust. We are fighting for every American mom and dad who wants to protect this land of liberty for their precious children. We have been blessed with the greatest republic on the face of the earth, but it was going in the wrong direction, and now we are turning it around, it is going better than ever before and we going to keep it that way. Were going to keep it that way. With your help, with your devotion, with your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning. We are one movement, one movement, think of that, we are one big beautiful movement. There has never been a movement like this, you dont hear it that often. They know it but you dont hear In the history of our country, there has never been a movement like this, and this movement is stronger now than it was three years ago. This is the strongest movement in the history of our country. But we are, were one movement, were one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. Were doing things that nobody thought was possible, no other nation thought it was possible what were doing. We are so respected, you have no idea how our nation has gone so far up in the eyes and the minds of the rest of the world. So respected. Because together, we will make America wealthy again, of course, we did just hit the highest price in the history of the market. So pretty soon, and I hate to say, I dont want to ruin the rhetorical skill, but that is sort of like getting a little obsolete, we will make our nation wealthy again. The fact is we have the strongest stock market in our history, so I think Ill have to change it. Youve all heard it many times, right, we will make America wealthy again, were going to have to say, We have made America wealthy again. So heres one, we will make America strong again. No, no, were going to have to change this, we have made America strong again. And just so you know, we have made America great again. Give up MAGA. How do you give up MAGA Make America great again, but weve done that. Can you imagine if keep America great didnt work I had the greatest phrase probably in the history of politics in this country. Look at her beautiful hat, it looks very good on you. But look at this, look at those beautiful hats. Make America great again, but weve done that. Our new phrase for the 2020 campaign is, Keep America Great. Thank you."
Milwaukee,Jan14,2020,"Well thank you very much. And Im thrilled to be back in Wisconsin where we had a very big night a few years ago. You remember that very big night Remember that They said, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. And since then weve produced everything we said and more and more. Before it was talk. I said, Im going to do this. Were going to take care of your trade. What weve done with China now, on Wednesday we signed, thats tomorrow. What weve done with the US MCA, what weve done with Japan, 40 billion trade deal that a lot of it has to do with the farmers. South Korea. Oh, you got to love Trump, you got to love Trump. And youre great Green Bay Packers are playing San Francisco this weekend. Good luck. So do we have any Green Bay packer fans here tonight Thats right. And you have a great quarterback whos a good guy, a good guy. As we begin the year, our economy is booming, wages are rising, poverty is plummeting. Crime is falling and America is the envy of the entire world. And then our opponents say, Were not going to win. Lets impeach President Trump. Lets impeach him. Weve got the greatest economy in our history. Our military has been totally rebuilt. Lets impeach him. But weve created 7 million jobs since the election, including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs. Nobody thought that was possible. And we will soon be replacing the NAFTA catastrophe, one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world, frankly with the incredible US MCA, Canada, Mexico, a giant victory for Wisconsin workers, farmers and dairy producers, a tremendous victory. And we may get that all taken care of this week or next week. It just needs one more vote and well get that out of the Republican Senate. The Republican Senate will be great. Tomorrow well also be signing our phase one trade deal with China, massively boosting exports of products made and produced right here in the great state of Wisconsin. So after years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the United States Military to a point that it has never been before and its now more advanced, more lethal, and more powerful than ever. And last year, our great American warriors, because thats what they are. And they love it. I got to tell you, they love it, right They love doing that. They wouldnt trade places with me under any circumstances. They wouldnt trade places with all of our great Wisconsin politicians. They want to be a military warrior and we dont want them for that. We want them doing what theyre doing. But our great warriors carried out a daring nighttime raid and terminated the founder and leader of ISIS. The animal known as al-Baghdadi is dead and the wicked caliphate is 100% destroyed. And I will tell you when we took over a little less than three years ago, ISIS was all over the place. Now the caliphate is 100% destroyed. Do you remember when I wanted to leave when it was at 98% I said, let some of the other countries finish it off. Were going home, right They all said, Oh, no sir, please finish it. So we finished it off to 100%. A few days ago. We took bold and decisive action to defend American lives and deliver American justice. At my direction, the United States military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the worlds number one terrorist, number one terrorist. Do you know who that is Qasem Soleimani, number one terrorist in the world. Soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of Americans and was actively planning new attacks, but we stopped them cold. And frankly, they already started the attack, as you saw in Baghdad, on our very large embassy in Baghdad. That was already started. And I said to our generals, Get there now. We dont want to have another Benghazi. Not on my watch, or on any watch. They said, Sir, well be there tomorrow. I said, Nope, you got to be there right now. Get them over there now. There are thousands of soldiers. They were soldiers. You take a look at that crowd. That was not protesters. They were soldiers, and they were surrounding our embassy in Baghdad. And all of a sudden they see these beautiful, very expensive, I will tell you, brand new Apache helicopters roaming over the top. And then they see our great military. You saw them in the plane, right Some of them were getting out of their pajamas. They were. I said, Dont worry about it. I said, We wont put that on. But they were sitting there and they were calling a roll call in the plane. Right And it was a beautiful sight. And these guys were better than Tom Cruise at his best.  Protestors Disturb the Rally. One protester, a very weak voice. If you people wouldnt go crazy every time you see something, hed go right through and nobody would even know she was there. Now shes going home to mom where she will be in big trouble. Because I guarantee you that mom voted for Trump. And in 10 years from now, when I run yet again, shell be voting for Trump too. Im only kidding. Im only kidding. We drive them crazy. We drive them crazy. They say, You know hes not leaving, dont you Hes never leaving. They say, Hes going to win. Hes never going to leave. These people, its called Trump Derangement Syndrome. It really is. You know what they dont know is that if for any reason, after five years we do leave, which we will, because I believe in that stuff. Right But you know whats going to happen to their industry. Theyre all going to die and fold up. Going to be very boring out there, very boring. Thats why I say at some point, every single one of them will be endorsing Donald Trump. But crazy Bernie Sanders and the Washington Democrats, by the way, Bernie is surging. Bernie is surging. Bernie. But the Democrats are outraged that we kill this terrorist monster even though this monster was behind hundreds and hundreds of death. Thats two. Hey, speaking of protesters, have you seen whats happened in Iran The protesters are on our side. First time ever. Theyre on our side. In fact, they put this big American flag on the street. And the Iranians, thousands and thousands of Iranians were supposed to walk on it and trample it and step and beat the hell out of it. Every one of them went around that flag. They like Trump. They like you. Im just your representative, but they like us. They like us. They havent seen anything like that in a long time. They went around, did you see it They went around the flag. They didnt want to touch it. They love America. They love our country. Thats called progress. Thats called progress. But the Democrats are doing everything possible to disparage what we did with the hit on this monster. Many of the young men and women you see walking around without arms, without legs and without  were done by Soleimani. Thats what he loved. He loved the roadside bomb. Thats what he loved. Thousands and thousands and thousands in Iraq, in Afghanistan, roadside bombs. He was the king of the roadside bombs. Great percentages of people dont have legs right now and arms because of this son of a bitch. Now the Democrats should be outraged by Soleimanis evil crimes, not that decision to end his wretched life. Theyre saying, Well, he was a general. He was this. He was that. You know what Number one, he wasnt supposed to be there. He was a designated terrorist by president Obama who didnt do anything about it as usual. As usual, they dont do anything. They designate and they dont do anything about. He shouldve been killed 20 years ago. Now, heres the story with the Democrats. If I didnt kill him, and lets say we lost three, four, five embassies or bases or thousands of people or hundreds of people or two people were killed, they would have said, Trump should have taken him out. Anything we do, they go the opposite. So we kill him. And that was precision. Some people thought it went much too fast. Went too fast. So we kill him and they say, What a horrible  If we didnt kill him, theyd say, What a horrible thing. Right And by the way, they think they caught me. They never catch us. Because Mexicos paying for the wall. You know that. Youll see that. Its all worked out. Mexicos paying. Its driving them crazy. Now they say, Okay, hes building the wall. But Mexico didnt pay. Mexico will pay. And heres the thing. Youll see that itll come out. Well do it sometime during the debate or maybe before. Our debate, the real debate that people are going to watch, because nobodys watching. havent been doing great on the debates. I have to tell you. But we are building this wall. Were over 100 miles right now. Were going to be expanding the length. You have a lot of natural where you have 1,978 miles. You need 500 miles, but 700 would be good, 750 or so would be great. Were going to now get it up. We have all the financing. You think its easy getting financing when people put  I can get anything from them. I can get whatever I want in terms of money except for a wall. And I made one big mistake. I should have said to them, We will not build the wall. We dont want the wall. They would have insisted that we build it. We would have had all the money we wanted. I made a mistake. I made a big mistake. Now were building the wall. Its going up and its going up rapidly and very soon well be building about a mile a day. And we should be up to over 400 miles by next year, the end of next year, and shortly thereafter itll be finished. And its already having a tremendous impact on people not being able to come into our country. Bernie and the radical left cannot protect your family and they cannot protect our country, nor do they want to, I think. According to Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren, who has somewhat less Indian blood in her than I do, and I have none. Remember Oh, we hit her hard. But I hit her too early, but now it doesnt matter. Shes not going anywhere. But Bernie said, according to her, Bernie said, and I dont believe that he said this, because I dont know him. I dont particularly like him. Hes a nasty guy. But I dont believe he said it. Its not his field. You have to know what people say. She said, right, that Bernie stated strongly that a woman cant win for president. A woman can win for president. Fortunately that could happen. Who knows But she said that Bernie said, A woman cant win. I dont believe that Bernie said that. I really dont know. Just its not the kind of a thing hed say. If you want to keep America safe, just vote Republican. Were doing so well. Were doing so well. Now this was  leave him alone. Thats all right. Let security just take care of her. Okay, you all right Get him out here. Good. Good job security. Good job. Do we love law enforcement And is there ever, ever a better place to be than a Trump rally on some night during some week The truth, is we have a great time. But you know what More importantly we get things done. Were getting everything done. But even president Obamas own former National Security Advisor, a highly respected general named Jim Jones, praised our action to take out Soleimani and said it was absolutely correct and it was the absolute right thing to do. Im sure they like him very much. He sounds like our kind of a guy. So Jim, if theyve given you a hard time, come on over to the Republican party. No, hes a respected guy. He said we did the right thing. Everyone knows. Theyre saying, Was the attack eminent Was it eminent Does the fact that hes killed hundreds of thousands of people and thousands of Americans and horribly killed and wounded thousands and thousands That doesnt matter. Was the attack eminent I think theyre going to start a new investigation. Was the attack or this horror  and by the way, he was in a country he wasnt allowed to be in. We dont mention that because he was designated and he wasnt allowed to be there. And he was there with the head of Hezbollah, and they were talking about, like Hillary Clinton. They were talking about weddings and working out. Soleimani and the head of Hezbollah, they were talking about weddings, working out. Or Bill Clinton in the back of the airplane with the Attorney General, where they may have made her an offer that youre going to go to the Supreme Court. Or they may have said, Youre going to to stay Attorney General, but help. Help. They may have said that. Do you think they would have said that No. Nothing like that. But do you remember They talked about golf and grandchildren, right 45 minutes. I like golf. 45 minutes. I like golf and I love my grandchildren. I dont think I can talk to somebody about them for 45 minutes that I dont even know. 45. I have a beautiful grandchild. Hes really beautiful. Hes so great. Okay. What else am I going to say, right Then I took a Lets talk one or two. Hows Tiger doing Hows this one Hows that one Thats another five minutes, right What am I going to do with the other 35 minutes Maybe Im going to talk about Supreme court appointments, et cetera. Got zero. He got zero out of it. He got zero. Id love to have that money back. Its a lot of money. But Ive warned the Ayatollah and the government of Iran that they must not harm, hurt, or kill any protesters. The whole world is watching. Its watching. Theyve killed thousands of protests. We support the Iranian people and their courageous struggle for freedom. Its incredible whats going on over there. It really is. But were watching it. Were watching very closely. And we were ready. That night when the attack was made on us, attack was made on us. Remember this, they killed an American, they killed other people just before that. And so we did what we did, right And they said, its our turn now. I said, you better be careful when you say its our turn. Because we had designated targets that you wouldnt know It would have taken him 30 years to rebuild if that was even possible. Its true, its true. And we saw those missiles launched, and they were big and they were fast, and they were accurate. Four of them went bad. They fell way short. But 12 of them hit. And I said, man, they are quick. They knew immediately what they were, and they saw those missiles hit. I said, how bad is it It hit a base. And an hour later or so, we get a call back. I said, how many killed Nobody, sir. I said, how many hurt They said, nobody, sir. And I said, they just saved themselves a trillion dollars and a lot of lives. Thats true. A trillion, not a billion. A trillion. So they did a very smart thing and were not looking for regime change. Theyve tried that with Libya. They go, Hillary Clinton, lets get rid of Libya. Lets get rid of Gaddafi. Lets get rid of Gaddafi. Hows that working out Right Lets get rid of Gaddafi. That was a Hillary deal. Then you had Benghazi. And see Benghazi, they didnt respond. They didnt respond. Should be. Should be to Iraq. Iraq didnt knock down the World Trade Center just in case anybody had any question. And this guy did kill. He was not a sweetheart. He was a bad guy in every way. But he did kill terrorists, right And it became Harvard University for terrorists, right But they did go after him, but he didnt knock down out. You know what I did with the soldiers They dont tell you the truth, sorry, because there are a bunch of corrupt people back there. I told Turkey, you got to defend your own border. Were not going to defend your border. And we get along with Turkey. We get along, but theyve been there for And by the way, I call it a safe zone. That is the most dangerous safe zone in the world. Okay Im looking at the audience, theres about three of you that want to be in that zone, okay And youre very tough people. But this is the most dangerous I call it, I call it the safe zone. Some day it may be a safe zone, but I took our soldiers out, because we had an army here and we had a vast number of people here, and they were going to fight. I said, if theyre going to fight like they have been for hundreds and hundreds of years, for centuries, let them fight. But were getting the hell out of there, okay But the fake news doesnt tell you the right story. But the fake news doesnt tell you the right story. Because what I did is I took our soldiers, and you know what I did I moved them to the oil area, and we now control the oil. So they said Trump stayed in Syria. Trump said, so people said to me, why you staying in Syria Okay A long time ago. You have no idea the things and the decisions Ive seen. So they say Trumps in Syria, I didnt pull out. I did pull out. We have the oil really secure. Well see what happens with it, but we can help our friends, the Kurds, because thats where they got their wealth. And then ultimately it was with ISIS. But right now its with the United States military. And we also got rid of remnants of ISIS. While were creating jobs and killing terrorists, democrats in Congress are wasting Americas time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts that had been going on by the way, from the day I came down the escalator with our future first lady. Somebody said to me recently, President, President, it was a friend of mine, used to always call me Donald. Hey Donald, how are you doing Lets go have dinner. Okay, okay, good. Now he calls me President. I told you this before. Calls me pres They always call me President. President, President, tell me whats happening, whats going on, hows it all going Youre doing such a great job. I said, do me a favor. Call me Donald. I cant. Now when they say, you know what that means, right That means respect for the office of president. And you know what Were going to keep that way. Were going to keep it that way. Were going to keep it there. But thats why this November were going back and were going to win the House. The Republicans are going to win the House. Because I dont know if you know it. The impeachment hoax, its a total hoax. This is based Just think of this. This is based on a perfect phone call. Did anybody read the transcript Its a perfect call. In fact, if you go back and look at Lyndon Johnson, all of them. Lyndon Johnson was sort of a tough guy. Can you imagine his phone calls Hes probably looking down or looking up, and hes probably saying, these people have gone crazy. Thats the nicest call Ive ever tracked. Somebody said, I never knew you could be so nice on a telephone call. But this is all based on a simple phone call that was totally appropriate where the president of Ukraine said there was no pressure on us. Didnt even know what they were talking about. The foreign minister said they want to impeach. Impeach the president of the United States over a perfect phone call. Its the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on our country. Ever. I dont know if youve seen. Independent voters and voters I think of all of the voters, including Democrats moving over, we just got a 195 to nothing, the Republicans in the house, which was a fix. Nancy Pelosi says it must be nonpartisan. And she said, it has to be clear cut. Well, number one, never happened. No problem. Number two, look at the vote. Three Democrats voted with us. So I guess you could say it was a nonpartisan vote because they voted with us, okay But were going back and were going to hold the Senate. And were going to keep the White House, but were going to win back the House. Were going to win back the House. And Im thrilled tonight. A man who has become a great friend of mine, hes a warrior. Senator Ron Johnson is here. Come up here. What a good guy. Congressman Bryan Steil. Jim Sensenbrenner. Glenn Grothman. Glenn, come up. Come up. Mike Gallagher. Wisconsin house speaker Robin Voss. Wisconsin state Senate president Roger Roth. State Senate president. Come on fellas. Wisconsin state Senate majority leader Scott Fitzgerald. A friend of mine, a world champion. Would you believe it Is Sean here Wheres Sean Wheres Sean Get up here. I love champions. He would climb that sucker. He was the best in the world right here from Wisconsin, right Congressman Sean Duffy. We miss him. But he signed with CNN. They paid him a lot of money, and they dont put them on. Why Because Im pro-Trump. You think thats fair, right Hes pro-Trump. So what theyve done is paid him money to silence him because he has a very important voice. Great job. Yeah, I like that kind of a job. I think hes okay with it. He gets his check, they refuse to put him on. He says good things about Trump. We dont want you on. Thats CNN. Thats how fake right there. Turn the camera on. And a good friend of all of ours, a Kenosha native, Reince Priebus. Reince, come up. Thank you, man. Thank you Reince. This is a great group of Republican people, but more importantly, its a great group of winners. They have been so great, so they worked so hard and I just want to thank you all for being here tonight. Thank you. Thank you Ron. A great guy. Thanks to strong Republican leadership like Ron, like all of them that you just saw, America is winning again. America is respected again. And America is thriving again like never before. Were doing great. Were the envy of the world. And under my administration, we now have the lowest average unemployment rate of any administration in the history of our country. And in your great state, Wisconsin You ever noticed with Biden, hes always calling the wrong state And in your great state of Iowa, Iowa. Its Iowa, right No, its Wisconsin. Oh, I meant Wisconsin. Oh, I didnt know I was in Wisconsin. Thats fine. How many times has he done that, by the way Lots of times, he said. Its great to be in the state of Ohio. No sir, youre in Florida. Many times. The sad part about that Sleepy Joe is right. You know the sad part about that When you do that, you cant really recover. You can be Winston Churchill, make the finest remainder of remarks, but you get killed. And he does it every time. And the fake news, they give him a total pass and thats okay. Its all right. Its going to happen to all of us someday. Does anybody get that Yeah. In Wisconsin, the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history. Hows that for a sound bite How do you beat that sound bite, right So now the people of Wisconsin are going to say, well lets see the state set a record, most successful its ever been. And by the way, thats because we got a lot of help from a guy named Scott Walker. Your governor. Ron Johnson, all those guys. Because this didnt happen so quickly. But think. So how do you beat that You have the most successful, lowest unemployment rate youve ever had. And then they say, somebodys going to come and say, well well do a better job. Really, youre going to do a better job The lowest in history by far, your number one economic numbers by far. Oh, lets put somebody else in as president. I dont think so. Right But heres one that I loved the most. African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country. And heres another one. African American youth, the way it was was so high was so horrible. Youth unemployment has reached an all time low in recorded history. African-American poverty has reached the lowest rate ever recorded also. The only question are you at 70, 80, 90, 97% He goes higher. What are you at Whats yours 100%. Not bad. I know who hes voting for. But think of this, because this is what its about. Is that these companies, these big public companies, theyre owned by the people, theyre owned by everybody. Rich people, and theyre owned by everybody. We have set 141 records on the stock market, highest levels ever in recorded history. 141 records. That means, in less than three years, for 141 days, we set a record. Think of it, weve said 141 records. Who the hell can do that And if our opponents had won the election, instead of going up, were very close to 30,000 on the Dow. Nobody thought that was possible. And clearly the fakers back there, nobody thought that was possible. Instead of being up, you would have I believe, I really believe, because regulation, so important, tax cuts, so important to get it all going. I believe instead of being up massively, whatever the number is, but depending on who you are, changes, but its all way over 60, 70, 80, you guys know. You would have been down 50, 60, 70. You would have been down at a level, you would probably be extremely depressed, right now. You wouldnt have bought all those brand new keep America great hats. Dont worry, were never getting rid of MAGA, dont worry. We dont have the courage to get rid of MAGA. The greatest campaign in history. Were never leaving. But you wouldnt have bought those hats. You know why You wouldnt have the money to buy him. Okay Now you can buy them, it doesnt mean a damn thing. So lets do it real fast. The poll, right Make America great again, or keep America great, right I dont have to go through the whole deal. Were going to do it quick. Were going to do it quickly. Ready Who likes make America great again Whoa. Theyre very loyal people in Wisconsin. Who likes keep America great All right. So it surprises me every single time. But make America great again, MAGA, has never won one of these polls. You know why Weve rebuilt our military, weve cut taxes, weve cut regulation, our stock market hit records. Its called keep America great. I mean, weve done so much. And I just got a free See these Democrats, they go out and spend 1 million on a poll. What I do is I take my own poll. And theyll interview 203 people. 203 people say theyll get it wrong. Because Im always surprised. Make America great again I think is the greatest phrase ever used in politics, right But under the Trump economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest, fastest, and largest games. You know that right This is a blue collar boom. They dont like telling you that. Under my administration, the growth in net worth for the bottom half of wage earners has increased 15 times more than under the three previous administrations. Thats pretty amazing. Because they keep saying, oh, the rich are getting richer. Well, the poor are doing the best theyve ever done. Earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% proportionately. Under eight years of the Barack Hussein Obama administration. Which administration loves spying on peoples campaigns By the way, by the way, could you imagine if it were the other way around and I spied on his campaign What would these fake news people be doing More than 300,000 people under Obama, 300,000 people left the workforce. Under just three years of by administration, 3.5 million people have joined the workforce and nobody believed that was possible. 370 companies have signed our pledge to Americas workers providing more than 14 million Americans with new training and job opportunities. Were training them. Were getting them, Walmart, so many great companies, theyre training people, because they can train a much better than government. 14 million, you know who has worked so hard on that Everybody, youve heard of Ivanka, right Ivanka. She had such a passion for it. Shes very smart. I said, would you like this You have no debt. I want to get people working. I want to get them and help families. So I said, all right, good. Look, shes smart. Go do whatever the hell you want to do, its okay, darling. So she had a goal of a half a million people. She was going to get trained, get into companies. So shed call Walmart, shed call Exxon, shed call all these great companies. And all of a sudden she hit 8 million. Then she hit 9 million. Dont forget, she wanted to do 500,000, but this is her. Then she had 10 million. She just hit 14 million people have been trained by these great companies. 14 million. Ivanka. 14 million, would you believe thats possible But thats why we have the best unemployment rates, we have the best employment rates. By the way, very close to 160 million people are now working in the United States. Nobodys ever even come close to that number. Weve lifted 10 million people off federal welfare programs. Real median income is now at the highest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Think of that. Real median income. Under eight years, so were here three years right, but really less because when it was done, the stats, it was two and a half. But we have less than three. Under eight years of the Bush administration, household incomes grew 400. Eight years, 400. Under eight years of president Obama, household incomes grew 975,000. Thats okay, 975. Eight years, right Under three years of the Trump administration, household incomes have risen 10,000. Ten thousand. Thats why were doing well. The consumer. 3,100 of which for regulatory cuts, 2,000 for the tax cuts, its actually higher than that, 2,500 for energy savings, and 5,000 in real wage gains. 10,000. The child tax credit alone, which every Democrat in Congress opposed, is delivering 2,200 a year to the average American family. Whos in favor of that cut. Whos in favor of having that You People dont know. They think the Democrats gave it. The Democrats give nothing. Theyre too busy. Theyre too busy doing other things. They dont do anything. Theyre too busy doing other things. We ended the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth. Number one in the world by far. Saudi Arabia, Russia, but were number one by far. And if I get a couple of additional pipelines approved, which I will very quickly, instead of waiting 20 years to get them approved, itll increase this by another 22% that will get them done quickly. And theyll be environmentally friendly and all of that. I believe in that. We have eliminated a record number of job-destroying regulations. I brought back the old light bulb. Better light for much less money, if you want it, right Little things. Somebody said, oh sir, dont mention the light bulb. Its hard to make an elegant speech. Im saying I brought back the light bulb. So the new light bulb costs you five times as much, and it makes you look orange. And I was more interested in the orange than I was in the cost. But you know what, if you want, you have it. And the new bulb, I dont know if you see it, its on there. Its a hazardous waste. When that bulb ends, youre supposed to take it to a certain dump and gingerly put it in because its loaded up with gasses. Thats the new I said to somebody today in Environmental Protection, how many people do that in the country Sir, maybe none. They throw it into the garbage can. And its Wait. And it was just announced from South Korea, makes a lot of our products, unfortunately, I put a tariff on washing machines and refrigerators, right They just announced that theyre building major refrigerator and washing machine plants in the United States. You know why You know why Because they dont want to pay the 25% tariff. So theyre building them here. That way they dont have to pay the tariff. And just one final thing. I know this doesnt matter, but I said leave it. Its so inelegant to- I know this doesnt matter, but I said leave it. Its so inelegant to talk about it, right Right Isnt it inelegant Im talking about dishwashers. Wait till you hear the next one. Im talking about refrigerators. Probably wanting to say to the union, Ill leave it out because I want to get praise for making a  You cannot make a brilliant speech where they say, That was such an incredible, elegant speech, if Im talking about dishwashers, sinks, toilets, light bulbs. But sinks, toilets and showers, you dont get any water. They put restrictors on and now they made them permanent. People used to take them out. They put restrictors on. Try going and buying a new faucet. You turn it on, no water comes out, right We wont talk about toilets, but you know thats  10, 15, but we dont talk about that. Because Ive said this three or four times, the only subject they ever talk about is toilets, so I dont mention  but how about the shower You go into a shower, and I have this beautiful head of hair, I need a lot of water. I need water. You go into the shower, right You turn on the water, drip, drip, drip. I called the guy, Something wrong with this No, sir. Its just the restrictor. So youre in there five times longer than youre supposed to be. You use probably more water and its a very unpleasant experience, right So were getting rid of the restrictors. Youre going to have full shower flow. Full sink. Did you ever go to the faucet You turn on the faucet to wash your hands and it turns on so easy. Its like this, because theres zero pressure behind it. No water. You go like that, the thing flips on. Whoa. And then, dung, dung. These people are crazy. And then in California, this governor, who has no clue by the way, he has no clue. Governor Gavin Newsom. He sends all the water out to the Pacific and then he just comes up  I dont know if you saw this. They come up with rules and regulations. Starting soon, if youre a person lives in California, you only get 50 gallons of water. Now, it sounds like a lot of water, but its not. If you take a shower, wash your hands a couple of times a day  Its not. Then it goes down to 47, 46, 45. Can you imagine You pay the highest taxes outside of New York, where theyre not doing a good job in New York. Theyre not doing good. Everyones leaving New York for other environs like Florida. Its not good. Because the taxes are too high. Governor Cuomos got to get those taxes down, got to get them down, and other things have to happen. But heres Gavin Newsom. So, Gavin Newsom, you have the water pouring down from up north, millions and millions of gallons. You know what they do with it They divert it into the Pacific Ocean, because they have  We must be in Wisconsin. No. Millions of gallons coming down from the north. They have this massive valve. Youre talking about a valve, this is a serious valve, and they turn it and it  Because they have a tiny, tiny little fish thats doing very poorly with or without the water. So in the meantime, if you own a home on Beverly Hills, they scream at you if you want to water your grass a little bit, right But you have no water coming in. They divert millions and millions of gallons. And what weve just done for the people of California is weve made it possible on a federal basis that they dont have to divert all that water anymore. Now thats only good for California, but these are the things we do. And now the last one is were working on cars. Were making them less expensive and safer. Were giving them a tiny little bit more fuel and youre going to save on average 3,500. Youre going to have a heavier car, a little bit, meaning youll have steel instead of paper mache walls. And were getting a lot of good response. And environmentally, its better, because now people  the number is 12. From 12 years ago, with the old gas guzzlers, theyll all be trading in their cars to get the new cars, which they dont do right now. So its really going to be something, and were in a little fight with California over that. But I think ultimately we win that one. Youll buy a better car, a safer car, for less money. Not a bad combination. Not a bad thing. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most, weve created opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring into 120 newly designated opportunity zones right here in Wisconsin. And Ron Johnson helped and Tim Scott of South Carolina helped, right Theyre doing great. They are doing good. And for decades politicians ran for office promising to defend Wisconsin workers, but then they went to Washington and lined their pockets with special interest cash as they shipped your jobs and your dreams to countries thousands of miles away. Countries that youve never even heard of. Globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob your factories, steal your farms. By the way, no estate tax on those beautiful farms. We got rid of that. So now, if you love your children and you have a farm or a small business or small ranch, or even a large ranch, you have no estate tax. You can give it to the kids. If you dont love your children  Anybody in here does not love their children There are some. Come on, raise your hand. There are some. You know, theyre brats. Theyre little brats. Theyre horrible human beings. So if youre one of them, this doesnt help you, because youll save some tax. The fact is, no estate tax on these small businesses and farms. Thats a tremendous thing, because you are dying, you are leaving the business to your kids. They all said, Thank you very much, Daddy and Mommy, and then they went out and mortgaged the hell out of the place and they ended up losing it to the banks. But we got rid of the estate tax on small farms and businesses and really great things. Little stuff like that weve done that we never said we were going to do, but these people were ransacking your communities. But we are defenseless no more, because at long last you have a president who puts America first. Been a long time. Been a long time. Been a long time. Were putting America first. No issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly betrayed the American people than that of immigration. He goes, Traitor. Are you having a good time, sir I think you are. Goes, Traitor. I guess in a certain way they are traitors, when you think about it. Left wing politicians, I call them the Do Nothing Democrats, support deadly sanctuary cities, demonstrating their contempt, scorn and disdain for everyday Americans. These jurisdictions release dangerous, violent, criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to rob, attack and murder American citizens. You have it right here. You have it right here. Last year, ICE  I love ICE. I think theyre so great. You know, they moved thousands of MS-13 out of our country, thousands, and others too. But ICE officers in this region of our country arrested nearly 7,000 illegal aliens with criminal records. So you have 7,000 illegal aliens having criminal records, including those charged or convicted of murder, burglary, robbery, drug crimes, killings in the most violent way. Right here in Wisconsin, cities run by far left politicians are releasing dangerous criminal aliens who abuse, assault and threaten innocent children. Your children. Last year, a place I like, the sanctuary County of Milwaukee, released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of child. Think of that, of children. Hes now at large. Theyre searching all over and hes looking for yet another victim. Theyre searching all over. Allowed to go from your sanctuary city. In the city of Madison, police arrested an illegal alien for sexual assault. After authorities released him, he committed violent battery, only to be released one more time. Theyre looking for him again. Isnt that nice The same illegal alien was then arrested for a third time in September and charged with multiple sexual assaults, including sexual assault of a child. Now that criminal is once again in Wisconsin jail and I call on your left wing officials to stop the madness and to work with ICE to ensure he is deported the hell back home. Get him out of our country. Democrats stand for crime, corruption and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order and justice. Its true. Its true. We believe Wisconsin should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members by the tens of thousands and we will not let them back. We made a deal with Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, where they accept them back. Under the Obama administration, they get them, they bring them back. And Honduras and Guatemala, which they get that, were not taking them back, but with us, they take them back. They take them back. Very great. It helped a lot when we were paying them hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Think of it. I just said, were not paying them anymore. All of a sudden they said, We would love to have our wonderful gang members back. We would love to have our gang members back, sir. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings, seven straight months in a row, and were being helped by our new 100 miles plus of wall. Illegal crossings are down 78% since May and we have ended catch and release. That was a tough one. Our very big and very powerful border wall is going up at a record speed and were fully financed now. Isnt that nice That wasnt easy. That was not easy. Were adding new miles every week and we are on track to soon build that wall. Youre going to have a wall like no other. Its going to be a powerful, terrific wall. And walls do work. I hate to say, remember the Democrats, You dont need walls. Oh really We need drones. They wanted us to put drones flying around, taking pictures of everybody. Now, did you see on part of the new wall two days ago, illegal aliens with drugs on their back were climbing the wall. They got to the top. You know that paddle on top is called a climb resistor. Its very slippery and very hot, very hot, and they got stuck on the wall. They couldnt get off the wall. Did you see that I was watching the news. I was surprised that the fake news showed it and I said, Isnt that a beautiful sight They couldnt get over the wall. Couldnt get off. They had to get the fire department to get them down. Do you believe that 30 feet up, thats like almost a four story building. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are now. Theyre going crazy. Theyre going totally loony. Nervous nancy, how about Nervous  How about her district Her district is so filthy dirty. Its filthy dirty with all of the things, I wont say it, but the needles and everything else. These are areas that were, 10 years ago, the best in the country and now theyre disgusting. She ought to spend more time back in San Francisco taking care of her community, instead of wasting everybodys time. But taking their cues from socialist Bernie Sanders, AOC, all these people, liberal lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million Americans of their private health insurance. Many of you have great insurance. Republicans will never let that happen. Theyll probably change their mind before the  See, this is why I dont like talking about it now. Id rather wait six, seven, eight months, let them say it 5, 000 times when they have to do it, and then talk extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God won five times. I said, Ive done one, but Ive won. But its the beep. But no, seriously, were all smart people. How is it good when they say, Were going to raise your taxes Is the world going crazy They say, Were going to raise your taxes. Were going to open borders. Everybody can come in  for everybodys health insurance. Schooling. You know, one time  were going to get everybody a Rolls Royce, and CNN or one of them said, They never said, and they never promised a Rolls Royce. Donald Trump lied tonight. I said, Every illegal alien will have a Rolls Royce. They said, He lied tonight. These people are sick. But theyre the party of late term abortion, socialism and corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American Dream, and of course, honest Abe Lincoln, right Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed. We are a movement. Theres a movement like nobodys ever seen before. You know, when I mention this, anything I say thats even slightly false, its headlines. Trump said this. These people. He said this. This is one of the greatest  I would say this. This is the greatest movement in the history of our country. I really believe that. Never been a movement like this. I mean, there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of nowhere won the state of New Hampshire, won Iowa, won South Carolina down the way, won a state some place. But we won 32 states. Theres never been a movement like this, never happened before. But were a movement for all Americans who believe in fairness and justice, equality and dignity, opportunity and safety. We are a big tent and we are a big party of big ideas for the future. Thats why African Americans are joining the Republican Party like nobody ever thought even possible. They love us and we love them. And to give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed. It was us, not the Democrats. They came to me, they wanted help, I gave them help. I got it done. I called Republicans that maybe wouldnt have been so inclined, some of them. Some of them very much inclined. Some of them very conservative were very much inclined. But I got the people that we needed. Obama couldnt do it. Bush couldnt do it. Nobody could do it. I got it approved, and from the day it was approved, I got no thanks, I got no credit. And thats okay, because you know, right But we passed bi-partisan criminal justice reform and thats helped so many people. I mean, you know the story of Alice Johnson. You know so many different stories. Its helped so many people, especially in the African-American community, the Hispanic community. Its helped a lot of people. Its a different world. To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 187 federal judges, a record, who will interpret the constitution as written. 187. Last spring, Wisconsin voters, as you know, elected a great judge to your State Supreme Court, and this spring you have a chance to reelect another terrific judge, Justice Daniel Kelly. Go vote for Justice Daniel Kelly to defend the rule of law in Wisconsin. Daniel Kelly. We are aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and weve done great  Look, until you get rid of it, you never did great, but we have done numbers that nobody thought possible. In 2018, drug overdose deaths, the overdose deaths, fell for the first time in decades, including by 10% in the state of Wisconsin, 17, 18, 19 and even 21% in a couple of states. China is now putting a big stop, a big lid on Fentanyl, which is a disaster coming out of China. Said to president, Youve got to do it. People are dying, got to do it. Theyre doing it. We are fighting very hard for school choice and its moving along well in Wisconsin. Milwaukee created the first school choice program 30 years ago to free children for failing government schools, and now my administration is working to give school choice to every child in America who needs it. As we continue rebuilding our military, workers are building brand new Humvee replacements  you know about that  in Oshkosh and magnificent new little old combat ships in Marinette. A lot of ships, a lot of Humvees. I recognized Israels true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, something theyve been trying to get for 52 years. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for you, the people of Wisconsin. At stake in our present battle is the survival of the nation. What these people are doing, they will destroy our nation. They will destroy our nation. And our last election was so important. I dont know, maybe the most important ever, but it was so important. I really believe that this election maybe in its own way will be just as important. I cant say more, but just as important, because we need time for that tree to grow. You plant a tree and it takes time. We need time for that tree to grow, and we have other things that we want to do. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020. Have to do it. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all, and I have found out what a swamp it is. Bad people. I have become the expert all what a swamp. You know, when I used to say, Drain the swamp, I had no idea it would be that bad. But were winning. Were here and theyre not. Were winning. Were winning. Bad people. Dishonest, bad people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration, which now were already doing. Were already doing a lot of it. Youve got to get loopholes. You know, you need their votes. We have loopholes, like visa lottery. We put names in a lottery and they come in, they become American citizens. Do you think these countries are giving us their finest Oh, lets give them our best citizens, put them in. These people are crazy to allow this to happen, so were stopping it all. But ending catch and release was a very big thing, and we did that with no Democrat help. They wouldnt do it. Its called loopholes. Who wouldnt want to end loopholes We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years. Who wouldve thought that We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, In God we trust. Theyll always be there. Well never let up remove it. Those words will always be there. From Milwaukee to Monroe, from Bayfield to Green Bay, good luck this weekend. And from West Bend to West Dallas, we stand on the shoulders of the most courageous men and women ever to walk on the face of the earth. Our American ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, landed men on the face of the moon, and made America the greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Wisconsin, the best is yet to come. You watch. Because working together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you."
Minneapolis,Oct10,2019,"Thank you very much. Thank you, Minnesota. This is a great state. We are going to win this state in a very short period of time. Thank you. This feels like the day before the election. So we have 20,000-plus people inside. We just set a new record. And we have 25,000 people that we still love, outside. And close to 100,000 people wanted to come tonight. Thank you all. This is great. This is really great. Thank you. I want to thank our great vice president, Mike Pence, and Karen Pence, for being here tonight. It is great to be back in the Twin Cities with the freedom-loving American patriots who make our country run. You know that. You know it. For the next 13 months, think of that, it seems like yesterday, for the next 13 months, we are going to fight with all of our heart and soul, and we are going to win the great state of Minnesota in 2020. America now has the number one economy anywhere in the world, and its not even close. You know Im dealing with China right now. Theyre in Washington. Were going to see if we make a deal. But they want to make it. Were going to determine whether or not we want to make it. But theyve been very nice. And today I got a call from one of the top representatives, he said, Congratulations, Mr. President, on having a truly great, great economy. Thats pretty nice. We picked up, since the election, trillions of dollars in value. And China has lost trillions of dollars in value. I will say this, if our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened Right now China would become the  It would be the number one economy anywhere in the world. And right now I can tell you theyre not even close. Our country is stronger than ever before because we are proudly putting, for the first time in a long time, we are putting America first.  cops love Trump, Trump loves cops. Our bold pursuit of this pro-American agenda has enraged, and you know whats happened, its enraged the failed ruling class in Washington. Not easy to get them out, but were doing it slowly, but surely. These corrupt politicians and the radical leftists got rich bleeding America dry. And they knew that my election would finally end their pillaging and looting of our country. And thats what they were doing. And thats what they continue to try and do. That is why, from day one, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election, the election of 2016. Theyre trying. Theyre not getting very far. They want to erase your vote like it never existed. They want to erase your voice. And they want to erase your future. But they will fail, because in America, the people rule again. Do you remember that, just 19 minutes after I raised my hand and took the oath of office, The Washington Post, a terrible newspaper that doesnt know how to write the truth, published a story, and in this case, they mightve gotten it pretty correct, they said, The Campaign To Impeach President Trump Has Begun. That was the headline. Little did we know they werent playing games. Think of that. That was 19 minutes after the oath of office. Months earlier, Peter Strzok, remember, he and his lover, Lisa Page. What a group. Shes going to win 10 million to one. Shes going to win. Im telling you, Peter. Im telling you, Peter, shes going to win. Peter. Oh, I love you so much. I love you, Peter. I love you too, Lisa. Lisa, I love you. Lisa, Lisa, oh God, I love you, Lisa. And if she doesnt win, Lisa, weve got an insurance policy, Lisa. Well get that son of a bitch out. We got an insurance policy. And were living through the insurance policy. Thats what it is. The phony Russia hoax.  Lisa, I love you. Now the do-nothing Democrat con artists and scammers are getting desperate. 13 months, they got to move fast, because theyre not beating us at the polls and they know it, despite the phony polls that you see all the time, their phony polls. You know, polls are no different. Remember I always used to talk about polls, I know polls very well. Polls are no different than crooked writers. Theyre crooked polls. Theyre crooked polls. No different. Boy, thats a lot of media. Look back there. Thats a lot of media. They are so dishonest. And frankly, they are so bad for our country. They are so bad. And they could be so good for our country. They could be so good. And maybe theyll change, and maybe they wont. Ive been waiting for a long time. After I won the last election, I said, Finally its okay. Finally Ill get some great press. They got worse. They got worse. I said, Finally, were going to get  I said to the first lady, Darling, were going to finally get respect. Were going to finally get media and press coverage. Its going to be great. Look at what weve done. And Im telling you, they did, they got worse. They know they cannot win. You understand. Well, if you didnt understand, honestly, theres no way anybody could win, because youd believe them. If you believe them, theres no way anybody could  Because its like 94%  I can do the greatest things in history, and theyll make them bad to very bad. And if I do a neutral, something neutral, it worked out okay, not great, its like, Give him the electric chair. That was terrible. Right No, this is the worst. These people and the Democrats, theyre partners. Its a partnership. How about on the newscast, like the word manufactured, its manu And every newscast, Tonight, in a manufactured deal along the border  The words never been used  All of a sudden every newscast is using it. Its a talking point given to these fakers by the Democrats. So they know they cant win the 2020 election, so theyre pursuing the insane impeachment witch hunt. Ive been going through it now for more time than Ive been in office. Because, like Strzok with his insurance deal, this was before, remember this, this was before, that statement was made months before I took office. That statement was made months before the election took place. They said, Just in case, were going to have an insurance policy. That only means one thing, Were going to get him out. So theyre telling us. We cant let that ever happen again to another president. And Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, a lot of people, the great Mark Levin. We have a lot of great people. Lou Dobbs, great people. You know what they said Every one of them, plus many others, Theres no other man that weve ever met that could have taken it. Its true. Maybe Im a little different up here. I dont know. But I enjoy it. To me, Im energized because were draining the swamp. The Democrats brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country. These are bad people. My phone call, as an example, with the president of Ukraine, was perfect. Everybody that looked at it. And the only reason I released it was that the Democrats put out a phony narrative. So I had no choice. And I dont want to do that as president, every time a president from a country calls me, or I call them, we have to release the text. How can you do business that way Whos going to want to speak to your president So the president of Ukraine reiterated today at a major news conference, on other subjects, that he was under absolutely no pressure. He doesnt even know what theyre talking about. And he used the word, there was no blackmail during this call. He used that term. So in theory, that should be the end of it. Think of it, a president of the United States whos made our economy, with a lot of help from all of you, frankly, but from Mike and from some of our great senators and some of our great people that we have with us, we made this the strongest economy in our history. Weve rebuilt our military. Were taking care of healthcare like nobodys been able to do. What weve done is incredible. And by the way, were protecting your Second Amendment. If you dont have me, your Second Amendment is gone. So we have the greatest economy, the greatest military. Weve rebuilt our military, 2. 5 trillion, because when I took it over, it was a mess. And what do they want to do Lets impeach our president, right I dont think so. I dont think so. I think were going to have a turnout the likes of which weve never seen in the history of our country. So we were really forced, just to put it away, we were forced. I said, Just do it. Got the approval from Ukraine. I have to ask. I said, Hey, do you guys mind They said, Thats a strange request. I said, Dont worry about it. Do you mind And they said, Please, go ahead. Nothing was said wrong on that call. So we released the transcript of the call, which was so good that that crooked Adam Schiff, this guy is crooked, he had to make up a fake conversation that never happened- A fake conversation that never happened, and he delivered it to the United States Congress and the American people. It was a total fraud. And then Nancy Pelosi said, Oh, I think the president said that. These people are sick. Im telling you, theyre sick. And you know what Had they waited one day longer, they would have had the transcript of the actual call, word for word. It wouldve been perfect. Instead, they released it, they went early, they said all these horrible things. You know why Because they never thought in a million years that I was going to release a transcript of the call. So Nancy Pelosi, upon hearing a false story from a whistleblower that had no clue what was going on in that call, or somebody gave her very bad advice, but also hearing it from shifty shift Nancy Pelosi said, a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the Ukrainian president, Weve got to impeach him. Weve got to impeach him. Right And then she saw the call and she said to her people, What the hell Nobody ever told me this was the call. But she keeps going anyway because the press is fake and they play right into their hands. The do nothing democratic extremists have gone so far left that they believe it should not be a crime to cross our border illegally, and it should be a crime to have a totally appropriate casual, beautiful, accurate phone call with a foreign leader. I dont think so. As our brilliant White House counsel wrote to the Democrats yesterday, he said, Their highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions, to our system of free elections, and to the American people. Thats what it is. To the American people. Its so terrible. Democrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy. Thats whats happening. We will never let it happen. We will defeat them. I mean, look at their debates. These people are crazy. They want to spend 99 trillion to redo buildings all over the United States. I said, What about China What about Russia What about India What about all these other countries where that stuff is just flowing out Its all right. Let him give you the answer. Man, did the cops act fast. Hes already gone. Thats unbelievable. Thats the fastest  You know I have  Look, I love law enforcement. I love the cops. I love the police, all of it. Minneapolis, Minneapolis, youve got a rotten man. Youve got to change your mayor. Youve got a bad mayor. Youve got a bad mayor. But you know what The police  Ive done this a lot and every once in a while well have very little disturbance. Its really  Actually, is there any place where we can have more fun than at a Trump rally And weve set every record at every place, virtually, that weve gone. And one of the big musicians said, And Trump does it without a guitar. Can you believe it Without a guitar. But this guy  So Ive had it a lot where  But sometimes itll take the police like 30 seconds, 50 seconds. Its like Roger Penske when you watch him, whos getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by the way, pretty soon. He won 18 Indy 500s, 18, Roger Penske. But its like the way they change those tires, takes four seconds to change the whole damn thing. I say, How the hell do they do it Thats the way these cops just reacted. That was a record. I think it was a  Ive had good service, but Ive never had anything like that. I look up, the guy is already gone. Ah, we love you with the red shirts. So now the Democrats are making a pathetic bid to save sleepy Joe, sleepy Joe Biden. And you know what Id love to run against him, to be honest. Anybody like that. If you cant beat him in a debate, youve got a big problem folks. You cant beat him in a debate, you cant be president. Because what are you going to do against President Xi and Kim Jong Un. You cant beat sleepy Joe, but now were going to meet with Kim Jong Un I dont think so. But hes totally owned and totally controlled by the Washington swamp for many years. Two months after president Obama put Joe in charge of Ukraine policy, they put Joe Biden in charge of Ukraine policy. Listen to this. And the press will not write it. They say, In totally unsubstantiated charges  every time they talk about him. President Trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune. Now you know thats a totally unsubstantiated charge. Really Its not an unsubstantiated, its fact. Joes son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days. By the way, whatever happened to Hunter. Where the hell is he Wheres Hunter Hey fellows, I have an idea for a new t-shirt. I love the cops, but lets do another t-shirt. Wheres Hunter Where is he Heres Hunter, being examined by sleepy eyes Chuck Todd or some of these people. Hunter, its so great that youre here, sir. Hunter, I know theyre giving you approximately 168,000 a month. I hear they paid you a big check of 3 million. I just want to speak on behalf of NBC whos absolutely one of the worst. I just want to tell you  Hunter, Hunter I just want to tell you I couldnt be happier for you and your family and I know you dont know anything about energy and I know its an energy company, but I think they made a great deal, Hunter. And then they fly to China, and Im dealing with people right now. Theyre tough as hell, those Chinese negotiators, and Hunter, whos not too smart, Hunter. He goes in, he has a meeting, he walks out in his fund with 1.5 billion, with a B, one point five billion dollars. These arent the same Chinese negotiators that Im dealing with, I can tell you. These are not the same ones, but we are doing very well in that negotiation. Now, think of it, wheres Hunter Where is Hunter I want to see Hunter Hunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything, frankly. Hunter, youre a loser. Why did you get one point five billion dollars, Hunter. And your father was never considered smart. He was never considered a good Senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obamas ass. True. Thank you. Thank you. Its true. Its true. And theyre always saying the same thing. Yeah, he got a billion five, we admit it, they admit it, its nothing, but oh, its not that same thing, president Trump made a totally unsubstantiated claim about Hunter Biden and his father. Its not unsubstantiated, you crooked son of a guns, its 100% true. 100%. Even the smart guys on Wall Street, and I know all of them, they are smart. Theyve never seen anything like that one before. Ive called them. Does that ever happen Never happens. Guy walks in, no experience, no nothing. Walks out with a billion five. Gee. Flies in on Air Force Two with his father, the vice president. Dont forget, thats when he was vice president. So China gives his son 1.5 billion. How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China I dont think so. I dont think so. Meanwhile, Biden allowed China to rip off America for eight years as vice president, and Barack Obama let him just rob us blind, and were not doing that anymore. Those days are over. The Bidens got rich and that is substantiated. While America got robbed, thats what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends out America, they didnt have tough negotiations. I look at these trade deals and I say, Who the hell could have done this If you didnt  If you had no business instinct, no business ability, if you had nothing, if youre dumb as hell, you wouldnt make these deals, theyre so bad. I say, Who made these deals Who made these deals But were ripping them all up and redoing them and theyre going to be very good. Wait until you see what happens. Now that Im your president, you see it. America is winning again and were respected again as a nation. A brand new report just came out as Im walking on the stage. Hard to believe, actually. It turns out that Joe Biden was vice president, he worked with the so called whistle blower. This is nothing but a partisan witch hunt, sabotage, and Im sure theyre going to say its totally unsubstantiated, but one of them wrote this story. Congratulations, by the way. Thats very nice. Thats really good. Thats the way you should do it. Good. Good. Good. In the twisted worldview of Democrats and the media, its okay for politicians to ship our jobs to foreign countries, flood our communities with drugs and crime, and enrich themselves at Americas expense. Their treachery is allowed because they go along with the rigged Washington game, and it is far more rigged. When I ran, I thought it was rigged, but this is crazy whats happening. But if you refuse to bow or bend to the Washington swamp, which I could do very easily, Id be much more popular. Folks, it would be so much easier. But they smear you, they spy on you, and they target your friends, your family, your staff for harassment, for abuse, for destruction. I came down to Washington with incredible people. We won a great political campaign. They were bright eyed and bushy tailed. thats a nice phrase. They came down, they were happy. They wanted to turn the country around. They wanted to do great things. All of a sudden they get summoned and they get subpoenaed by Robert Mueller. How good was he as a witness Not too good and by people that were, I call them the 13 angry Democrats, that turned into 18 angry Democrats. It was disgraceful. So people that were going down, Sir, what is this I look, Oh wow, thats a subpoena. What the hell is this They took people  I really mean this. They took people that were full of life and energy and vigor. We had just won the greatest campaign in the history of American politics, its true. Its true. And they destroyed their lives. They destroyed their lives. They went home. I could name many people, one in particular, who came down, an incredible young woman. She was going to help people. She wanted to help people. She had causes that were so good. She wanted to help people, and she ended up going home, dark, dark. Her life became hell. They ruined people. They destroyed people, good people. People that ended up paying far more money in legal fees than they made. Than they made. They destroyed great people. Theyre vicious, horrible, and the media was behind every single step. They destroyed so many lives. They destroyed so many lives, and theyre continuing to do it. And its a disgrace. When all of their ludicrous hoaxes have been exposed as frauds, these sinister fakers then tried to impeach you for daring to call out their own corruption. Theres nothing like the dirty political establishment, and I have to tell you, this is, friend of mine, very smart, brilliant guy, was with me about two weeks ago. We just got rid of the Russia hoax and then a week later the Ukraine hoax starts. I had a week of like, I can think about everything perfect. Its so beautiful. And he said, President. I said, Call me Donald. Youve called me Donald for 35 years. I will. Thank you Donald. Ive lost all my friends because theyre all scared to talk. Honestly, Im the president that they cant talk to me anymore. Its like theyre afraid. They respect the office. Its true. They say, President. I say, Do me a favor, Richard. Youve called me Donald for 35 years. Call me Donald, please. I want somebody to call me Donald. True. He said to me, I just told him call me  He said, President, I cant do it. He said. So he says, President, youve been here now for, think of it, almost three years. Can you believe were here three years We, we, its we. And we have to promise them no more than 16 years. Okay No more. No more. 16 more years. Im only kidding. Now theyll go back. See, he wants to run for more. But he said, President, could I ask you a question Its so important to me. Hes a great businessman, very successful. He said, You deal with all of these nations, these great, powerful  Who is the worst to deal with Is it China Is it North Korea Is India Is it Russia Please tell me, Mr. Pres, who is the toughest nation to deal with I said, Youre not going to believe this. Its the USA is the toughest nation to deal with. The USA. Its true. Because were dealing with some very sick and deranged people. There is nothing that the dirty political establishment hates more than a president that they cannot intimidate, own and control. Theyre trying to stop me because they know that I dont answer to them, I answer to you. Its true. I never say this. I dont think Ive ever said it in a speech, but theyll find out if I did. Theyll give me Pinocchios, he said it before, but I dont know if I ever said this before. But I make, as president, about 450,000. I give it away. I dont care. I dont want it. I never hear anything. Can you imagine if I didnt. I give it away to  You can only give it, you cant keep it. You cant actually make a gift. You can give it to your different agencies. So I can give it to health, I can give it to transportation, I can give it to military, but I give it away all the time. Now, and if I ever did  But its 450. If somebody stays from, lets say, a middle East country in one of my hotels and we charge him 392 dollars and 53 cents for staying, and I never heard of the guy and I dont want to hear about him, they say, Trump is getting rich off our nation. I lose billions being president. I dont care. Its nice to be rich, I guess. But I lose billions. If somebody rents a room someplace and they pay me two months in rent or hotel fees, I never heard of the people. I never know who they are. They say, Emoluments. Nobody ever heard of the word emoluments before. Emoluments. Its the craziest thing Ive ever seen. I tell you, its cost me billions of dollars to be president. It really has. And at some point Ill probably to prove that, and I look forward to doing it.. Its very easy. Its very easy. And there is nothing that makes me happier than making that decision to run and win and straighten out the mess that these people have created. So in desperate attempt to attack our movement. Nancy and Chuck, two beauties, have given control of the Democrat party entirely over to the radical left, including Minnesotas own representative Ilhan Omar. I know you people. I know you people. I know the people of Minnesota, and I want to tell you, and I also, at the same time, its both a question and a statement, howd the hell did that ever happen How did it happen How did it happen Congresswoman Omar is an America hating socialist. She minimized the September 11th attack on our homeland. Where far more than 3,000 people died, saying, Some people did something big deal. Some people did something. She pleaded for compassion for ISIS recruits right here in Minnesota. Omar laughed that Americans speak of Al-Qaeda. You remember that tape Speak of Al-Qaeda. But when we say something about the United States, you just dont say America with any intensity. Remember that Representative Omar has a history of launching virulent anti-semitic screeds, whether you like it or not. Shes said the US support for Israel is all about the Benjamins. She said that pro-Israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country. Omar wrote that Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them to see the evil doings of Israel and the United States. How do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota Im very angry at you people right now. She is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the big reasons that Im going to win, and the Republican party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months. Thank you very much. So were honored to have with us today a special guest, a man that really is a terrific talented writer. He knows a great deal about all those tangled lies of Omar. Mr. Scott Johnson of Power Line. He wrote some stuff, I cant believe it. Wheres Scott Wheres Scott Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Scott. What a job. Man, do you have her figured out. The only problem is, Scott, its incredible talent, much more talented than most of these people that you heard about. The problem is they never pick it up. They dont want to pick it up, but we pick it up, Scott, and the people get it and we thank you for your great reporting. Thank you. Thank you very much. And Scott reported everything about Omar is a fraud, including her name. Scott reports his sources told him that, quote, Omars legal husband was Omars brother and that she had married him for fraudulent purposes. You mean like coming into the United States, maybe And as Scott says, We have seen a plethora of congressional scandals in our history yet we have never seen scandals like Omars in Congress, and nothing gets done about it. I hope that some of you people are looking, because what AOC has gotten away with campaign financing and what  I call it AOC plus three, thats what it is. And Omar is one of the three. What AOC has gotten away with all of that money that she used for her personal self with campaign finance is worse, and nothing happens to them, but it happens to you, and its not fair. The fact is, were in a struggle for the survival of democracy in America. The only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand- Message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd, 2020. With your help, we will win back the House, we will keep the Senate and we will win the White House. And were thrilled to be joined tonight by some incredible people that have helped me so much. One of your tremendous talented, tough, Congressman Tom Emmer. Tom. Also a man, you dont want to fight him, and you dont want to play him in hockey because he was tough. He just won, not that recently but pretty recently, and I was out here campaigning for him and working hard, and it turned out to be an easy race because everyone loves him and respects him. Congressman Pete Stauber. And a man who gets in the trenches, and he just doesnt care. He wants to win for the people. He loves you. He loves this state. He loves this country. Jim Hagedorn. Thank you. And a great friend of mine with his incredible family. Hes a friend. Hes smart. I guess youd say hes brilliant. His education is incredible, his military career has been incredible. Then he ran for office, and now hes a United States Senator from the great state of Arkansas, Senator Tom Cotton. Great guy. And Minnesota Senate Majority Leader, Paul Gazelka. Paul. Thank you Paul. Minnesota GOP Chairwoman, Jennifer Carnahan. Shes been incredible. I said, Jennifer, are we going to win in 13 months She said, Honestly sir, Ive never seen anything like this. Its going to be easy. Dont ever say Just assume were two points behind, okay Two points behind. You never ever Please. Always just assume youre a little behind, but were going to win this state by so much that people are going to be shocked. Ad plenty of other states too. We had a rally three weeks ago in New Mexico, and New Mexicos a hard state for Republicans, hasnt been won in a long time also. And we had receptivity that was unbelievable. The audience was 40% Hispanic, where were doing great. And you know, Hispanic, they understand borders better than anybody, better than we do. They understand safety, they understand their job, they dont want people taking it away, they dont want crime. They understand it better. Thats why were doing so well, but were in New Mexico, and Im telling you, that was electric. But honestly, all evenings are electric. We havent had any bad ones. We havent. Theyre all electric. A woman who headed up the great state of Michigan for me, a state that hadnt been won in a long time by a Republican for whatever reason, but it hadnt been won. I guess we didnt have the right candidates, right But a woman who would call me constantly. Id say, I dont want to talk to her. Shes giving me a headache. Sir, if you make one more trip, youre going to win Michigan. I say, All right, I make the trip, I go back home. I get a call the next morning, Sir, we need one more. This went over and over and over, and we ended up winning the state of Michigan, and I said, Who the hell was that woman that kept bugging me to go back to Michigan and speak just one more time every week One more time, sir. And her name is Ronna McDaniel. Shes fantastic, and shes the head of the RNC. Shes great. And our campaign manager, a man whos really been They used to say that Crooked Hillary had a very very sophisticated campaign. After she lost, they said, I guess it wasnt sophisticated. We had a sophisticated campaign. Nobody knows the world of computers better than this guy. Brad Parscale. Remember when they used to say it You know, I never got credit. My father used to teach me, if you can do it for less and win, thats good. He wasnt talking politics. The last thing Hes looking down. Hes definitely looking down, not looking up. He was great. He was tough, but he was great. But my father would say, If you could do it for less and win, thats a good thing, not a bad thing. If you can build a building for less money than the guy across the street, and if its a nicer building and you can rent for less, youre really Thats like a good thing. So in the campaign, we spent much less money than Crooked Hillary Clinton, much. And we won. And we won. We won 306 to 223. Thats a pretty big Remember Remember they said electoral college. By the way, when you run, if youre running, the electoral college is like the 100 yard dash, and the total vote, you dont go certain places. You focus. Electoral college. We have to explain to them, its different. So we won 306, and do you remember they sued to say ones the 100 yard dash. You practice. Ones the mile. You practice. Its a different race. Winning the total vote is much easier in my opinion. The electoral college, I had to go to 22 different states. For the total vote, Id go to four states maximum, right Much easier. Its much easier. Im all for it, but the electoral college is better for our country because it forces you to go places that you wouldnt go. I love Maine. I went to Maine four or five times. I needed one point. Maine gave me one point. And what happened What happened I went there numerous times. Everyone said, Why Because I was told by these fraudsters back here in the media that Trump cannot get to 270. He cannot get They had me maximum, if everything worked, right At 269. So I kept going to Maine, and you know what We won that one point in Maine. We won it. Its true. But I kept going. They say, Why I said, Well, first of all, it is really a beautiful place, but we won the point. But they said, He can not get to 270, and I heard this for months and months. I had such a headache, almost as bad as listening to Mikes damn commercials about those pillows. Maybe I need one of those pillows to cure my headache. Does it cure headaches I think so. But heres the thing. Heres the thing. So they said, He cannot get to 270. In other words, you cant win. You dont get to 270, its over. You cant win, right He cannot do it. Theres no way of doing it, and they were right. I got to 306. They were right. But I didnt get to 306. You got to 306. We won incredible states. We won incredible states. We won Wisconsin, we won Michigan, we won Pennsylvania, we won North Carolina, we won South Carolina, we won Florida. What a run. Do you remember the evening that we won I think Look, forgetting me, I think it was won of all of us together because we all worked hard. I was the messenger, but we all worked hard. That was our victory, not my victory. But that was one of the greatest nights in the history of television, one of the greatest nights, and hopefully itll go down when were allowed to get all of this stuff seeded You know, its like a tree. You plant it. You plant it. It has to go, but it needs a little Thats why we need the four more additionally years. Its got to grab on and catch, so they cant destroy it. So they cant destroy it. But I think itll go down, and I hope its going to go down as one of the greatest evenings in the history of this country, because its never happened, anything like that before. And these guys dont even question it. They just sit back and say, I guess hes right about that. Ill never forget the night before, I was at a tremendous arena. The place was going crazy. It was like this, going crazy, and two reporters that hate my guts, they looked at themselves, they looked at each other. Famous shot. Theyre looking like this and theyre saying, What the hell is going on They knew. They knew. And I didnt need Beyonce and Jay Z, and I didnt need little Bruce Springsteen and all of these people. Theyd get all these people. Theyd come in because she couldnt get a crowd. Theyd come in, theyd sing. They got Bruce Springsteen. Okay Hed do about two songs and leave. What happens is, they leave, and then everyone leaves with them, and shes still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd. Its the craziest thing Ive ever seen. And then they complain. Sometimes Ill use terrible word like hell. The other day I used the word hell. I got hell from They said, He used terrible language. I used the word hell. It was so bad. But youve got to hear Jay Z, the words he was using, he was using the F word all over the place, and then the next day they say I use bad language. The word hell is a terrible word. These people are sick. But that was an amazing evening. Ill never forget that evening. Look. Outside of your family and your children and things I love you too, darling. It was one of the highest rated evenings in the history of television. You add up all those networks. Remember the woman crying Oh my God. No, they werent biased at all. Now, another very special man whos with us today, but hell never be a man to me, hell always be my boy, you know what I mean Right Hes my boy. Hes my little six foot six boy, Eric Trump. And the parents understand that, right They may be big and strong and older. To a parent, a child is always their boy or always their little beautiful girl, and I know thats probably politically incorrect. Theyll say, It was terrible what he said about women. Terrible. But theyre our boy and theyre our girl, and it doesnt matter how old we get and how old they get, is that a correct statement And Im also proud to endorse your next Republican Senator from Minnesota, a man that Ive known, a man that is tough and smart, a man thats running against somebody thats never done a damn thing in the Senate, Mr. Jason Lewis. And Jason did a great job in Congress. Congressman Lewis, thank you very much, and thank you for putting up with all of this stuff because Ill tell you, its going to be nasty. Its going to be nasty. Theyre going to make up stories about you. Theyre going to say things thats going to want to make your wife say, Why did I marry this guy Just say, Dont worry about it. Its just another phony story. Thank you very much Mr. and Mrs. Lewis. Jason, thank you. And Jason, they can say that about Tom Cotton. Hes too perfect, this guy. He cant say They cant say it about you, Tom. Anyway, good luck Jason. Do well. And I dont know why, but with all of the great people I just introduced, for tonight, maybe this is the most important person, because I turned on a very good show in the morning. Fox and friends. They treat us great. I just want fairness. What a great group. Ainsley and Steve, and by the way, Brian has gotten a lot better, right And how good does Jessie Waters do How good Right Just some really great people. And again, Tuckers been very good I have to say. Hes been good. Smart. Hes been great. Tucker, and the legendary Sean Hannity. Great. Number one. Number one show. Seans got the number one show. And Laura Ingraham is knocking them out of the park, Laura. And you go over, Maria Bartiromo, and the great Lou Dobbs. How good are they Lou Dobbs. And many more. And many more. How about Greg Greg used to hate me. Now, hes good. Oh, we cant forget We cant forget Judge Jeanine. I would be in such trouble if I forgot Judge Jeanine. No, these are And there are many more. I just Look, Im just rattling some names off, but theyre just terrific people. Theyre terrific people. But a man that I have to really say something very special about 00 slot, because Im out of there pretty good, and I see a handsome young man named Bob Kroll, Cops For Trump. And hes talking about this lousy mayor theyve got. Now, he didnt quite say that, but I say it. Hes talking about this lousy mayor that wont let the cops, the police, the law enforcement My father always used to say, Son And he meant it to. Never say cops. Its disrespectful. Say police officer. I said, Okay Pop. But honestly, the truth is with time, I love you guys whether youre cops, police officers, law enforcement. Ill call you whatever you want. It doesnt matter. You are so great, so respected. You dont even know how much our public loves you. You dont know it. You dont know it. You dont know it. But I see this guy, and I dont know if hes done a lot of television before, but he was very effective and very good. And he was saying how the police arent being allowed to take care of this rally, and yet with President Obama and Bush and all these people, they were fine, fine. Everybody comes. They fall asleep at a rally. But they werent allowed to do the job for us, and they went wild. So what I want to do Go home to Mommy. Mommy says, I saw you on television tonight. I love Trump. Dont you ever do that again. Yes Mom. Yes Mom. But the job he did before the election, I came right here to Minnesota, and I pledged to address this really important issue, and its the issue of law enforcement. And when I saw this man, this great gentleman on television pouring out his guts, pouring out his heart I dont know him. He knows Ive been good to law enforcement. He knows Ive been good to, as my father would say, The police. He knows I love the cops. He knows that, and so does everyone else. I mean, its so many shirts, so many red shirts, and there are plenty of people here without the red shirts, and I want to just tell you, the respect that we have for law enforcement is unbound. Its unbound. Come up here. Bob, come up. Say something. Thank you fellas. Ill see you later. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great people. Thank you. What a group. I think your very weak mayor made a mistake when he took them on. As you know, for many years, leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers. I promised you that as president, I would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy, and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls. And Ive done that. Since coming into office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85%, and as you know, maybe especially in Minnesota, I kept another promise. I issued an executive action, making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state. So speak to your mayor. You should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods, and thats what you have the right to do right now. And believe me, no other president would be doing that. If Democrats were ever to seize power, they would open the floodgates to unvetted, uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before. Do you think you have it bad now You would never have seen anything like what they want to do. But in the Trump administration, we will always protect American families first, and that has not been done in Minnesota. Weve also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place. We are keeping terrorists, criminals and extremists the hell out of our country. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. The president of Mexico has been incredible. We have now, 27,000 Mexican soldiers. Theyre great, and theyre tough, and they are now protecting our border, and those numbers have gone down like this. Thank you Mr. President. We will not make the mistakes made in European countries, that allow a violent ideology to take root in our country, on our shores. Were not going to allow it to happen. And as you all know, to protect our citizens from those who would do harm to us, I instituted a very controversial, very hard to get, travel ban on some of the worlds most dangerous countries. And the other day, one of the fake news reporters in the back said They were talking about the travel ban, and they said, Well you know, the president has lost in court. They said, Where On the travel ban. And hes right. I lost, and then I lost at the appellate division, and then I won at the United States Supreme Court. Right And he knew that, but he said I lost on the And he was right. I lost, and then I lost again, but then I won, and we have the travel ban. But instead of saying, He lost, and then he lost at the appellate, and then he won at the United States Supreme Court, he said, He lost on the travel ban. These are very dishonest people. Do you understand that Very dishonest people. In the Republican party, we believe that those who seek to join our society must embrace our values, honor our history, and love our people. Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities, and were not letting it happen anymore. Republicans believe American cities should be sanctuaries for Americans, not for criminal aliens. My administration is taking historic action to secure the border. We have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May, and we are building the wall faster than anyone ever anticipated it could be built. And this is a serious wall. Youve all seen it. Its going up rapidly, and you think that was easy I had every Democrat in Congress fighting me, fighting me, fighting me. I had a lot of the rhinos fighting me. They say, See, hes not getting it built. Hes not getting Let me tell you. You have every Democrat fighting you. We took it from here, and we took it from there, and we took it from all over the place, and we got that thing. Thats the biggest patchwork of financing youve ever seen, and that sucker is going up, and it is the finest, it is the strongest, its largely 30 feet tall, which is the maximum height that they wanted. I went to the Border Patrol, and I sat down with 15 representatives of the Border Patrol, and I said, What do you want Whats your ideal I actually said, I want to give you the Rolls Royce, and they killed me for that. They said, Its not an American made product. Yeah, they happened to be right. No, theyre right about that one. Theyre actually right there, Tom. But I said, I want to give you the Rolls Royce of walls. Tell me. And they told me everything, and then we built some alternative walls. We built all different types. We built about seven of them, and then we had climbers come in. The one that worked the best was the one were building. It also, unfortunately The bad news, its also the most expensive. But we got it for the right price. We got it for the right price. Its steel, its hardened concrete, its deep, its high, its a thing of beauty. And its going to keep bad people out of our country. Thats what its going to do. And the Democrats knew this. Most of the Democrats four years ago, they wanted a wall. Now all of a sudden, they dont want a wall. You know why they dont want a wall Because I want it. Thats the only reason. And I just thought of it a year ago. I said, Man, this couldve been so much easier. All I had to do is say, We dont want a wall, and they wouldve given me all the financing I wanted for the wall. What was I thinking Were not going to build a wall, and they would have forced me to build it. I wouldve Its true. Under this administration, we are also ending the-  this administration. We are also ending the endless wars. We have to do it, folks. We have to do it. We have totally defeated the ISIS caliphate, and I did that in rather quick time if you remember, because we have the greatest fighting machine, now. When I came in and was totally depleted. We have great generals, we have great warfighters, and they did it so fast. I flew to Iraq, I met with the generals, right I met with the generals. I said, I hear its going to take a year to two years. Sir, we can do it in two weeks. I said, What They dont let us fight, sir. They dont let us fight. We want to fight. They dont let us fight. I said, I let you fight. I said, How come if they say its going to take anywhere from a year to two years, you say you can do it so quickly He said, Sir, were going to hit them from the front. Were going to hit them from the back. Were going to hit them from the sides, from underground, from overground. We going to hit the hell out of them. And they did. And we won very quickly. But from now on, we want to fight where it is to the benefit of the United States of America, not to the benefit of other countries. And we will only fight to win. Were only going to fight to win. We dont fight to win. We dont fight to win. The Turks have been fighting with the Kurds for two centuries, and Turkey, as you know, is a NATO ally. But Ive been rough on them. Weve defeated 100% of that ISIS caliphate, and no longer have any troops in the area. We dont have any troops. The troops have been pulled out. Where Turkey is carrying out now a very tough campaign against the Kurds, get them out. So Turkey is right now waging a very tough campaign against the Kurds. We got along with the Kurds, and we helped the Kurds. And dont forget theyre also fighting for their land. You know that. But theyre fighting. So we have three choices. Youre ready Here are the three choices. We dont have any soldiers there because weve left. We won. We left. Take a victory, United States. We left. Take a victory, take a victory. Bring our troops back home. I told this story yesterday, I have to sign letters, its the hardest thing I have to do. I sign letters, Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith from Arkansas. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Jones from Alabama. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Somebody from some great state, Im sorry to inform you, your son has been killed in combat. Im so sorry. And every letter is individually done because sometimes the parents, theyre grieving, and they get together with other parents, and I dont want to see that its like the same letter. So we do different letters. Its the hardest thing I have to do. Hardest thing.its the hardest thing I have  I was telling Tom Cotton, its the hardest thing that I have to do. And I sign those letters, and it just, it breaks your heart. And by the way, theres a time to fight. Nobody fights harder than I do. But theres a time, and theres not necessarily a time. But I send these letters out, quite a few. And sometimes I send letters out, its called blue on green, where were teaching people how to fight and then they turn the gun on our soldiers and shoot them in the back. And thats the hardest thing for a parent. I have all of them. I know everyone. Thats the hardest thing for a parent when they get notification, because they learn how their child has died. When the so-called people that were teaching how to fight turn the gun on them, and shoot. Weve had a lot of that, a lot of it in Afghanistan, more than weve ever had proportionately before. Its a horrible, horrible thing. But I have to sign these letters. And sometimes I go out to a place, Dover Air Force Base, its a very tough experience. Mike Pence goes, I go, other people go, Tom Cotton goes. We go out there, and we meet the parents and the families, the wives, the children, the sisters, the brothers. We meet them, and we talked to them, and their son or daughter is being flown in from some far away place in a coffin, and these things are just impossible. I dont know how parents can do it, even. And Ill meet them. And we have a particular Colonel, thats all he does. So good. So professional. Thats what he does. He said, I greet the dead, sir. I greet the dead. And what happens is this big incredible machine flies in, this tremendous cargo plane, and it flies in so powerful, so big. Ill be talking to some of the parents, and theyll act like theyre fine. I said, How are you doing Were fine, sir. Were fine. Were really good. I say, Thats great. And Ill tell the Colonel, Ill say, Colonel, I think theyre doing great. No sir, theyre not going to do great. Youll see. And I didnt know what he was talking about, this is the first time. Then we went outside to the runway, and this incredible machine is flying in, and it lands, and it comes over, and it pulls up, and we have military guards, we have incredible talented musicians that do this. Thats what they do. What happens is that door opens up, and the Colonel told me, he said, Sir, when that door opens up, those same people that you think are okay, do things that youll never see. You will hear sounds like youve never heard. Thats what he does. I saw that door open up with a coffin with a flag over it. The door was opened, and these beautiful soldiers, five or six on each side, lifting the coffin and walking down the runway, the plank, they call it, off this cargo plane. And I see parents make sounds, that were just 20 minutes ago absolutely fine, make sounds, scream and cry like youve never seen before. The Colonel was telling me that, Sir, youll see things that youve never seen before. A mother who was fine 20 minutes ago, you think, breaking the military line and jumping off, and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter, jumping on, on top of the flowers, on top of the American flag. Ive seen this. Then I have all these people that want to stay. They want to stay. And I dont want to stay. We were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days. Weve now been there for 10 years. We were supposed to be in Afghanistan for a short period of time. Were now going to be there for close to 19 years. Its time to bring them home. Its time to bring them home. Its true. Time to bring them home. Weve done our job, weve defeated everyone that were supposed to defeat. And now we are, we are policing, we are now policing. Thats what were doing. Were policing. And that, as I said, no more respect for the police, but these are military people, and those are police, but we are now policing. Were not fighting, were policing. And you know what After all of these years  One other story, and I have to tell you. I go to Walter Reed on Friday, and I do it quite often. I gave out five Purple Hearts. And I meet people that are so beautiful, so amazing. I met five warriors, and one was so badly hurt, with the loss of arms and a leg, another one  theyre just very, very devastated. But these are great, great people. And I gave out the Purple Heart. And I see the parents, and I have to say, Walter Reed, I want to just say, the doctors there, the job they do, you know, you hear so many complaints about doctors and about the vets, and the vets care, and nobodys done better. We got choice for the vets. We did things for the vets that nobody thought would be possible. But I saw these young men, and I gave them their Purple Hearts. And their parents were there crying. And one of them was so amazing. I said, Whats your problem Sir, my face was blown apart. My nose was absolutely just blown apart. He said, Sir, its incredible. And I looked at him, I said, Thats the most beautiful nose Ive ever seen. What do you mean He said, A doctor worked on my face for 10 hours in the field. He said there were a thousand fragments. Now I dont know if thats right, but well, a lot. He meant a lot. He said there were a thousand fragments. He rebuilt my nose with glue. He glued the bones together. He rebuilt my nose. I say, You have the most beautiful nose Ive ever seen, and its true. And his father came over to me, he said, Sir, father was crying, he said, Sir, honestly, my son looks better now. He said, My son did not have a good look. He knows. Now look at it, its beautiful, its beautiful. But these doctors at Walter Reed, and these Army, and Marine, and the medical doctors, they are unbelievably great people. And they see sights that you and I hopefully will never see. They see things that nobody will ever see, and theres nobody like them. And I have to give a shout out to those people, theres nobody like them. So in the case of Turkey, and Syria, and the Kurds, we could send in a thousand troops for a military conflict with Turkey. No, you dont want to do that. We could hit Turkey very hard financially. Or we could mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds. I like that. You know Lets mediate a deal. But remember theyve been fighting each other for hundreds of years, and we were artificially put there, in this case by President Obama. So we did our job. We knocked out. And Ill tell you another thing, we have to be treated fairly. We have to be treated fairly. Were not treated fairly by other nations. We captured many, many ISIS fighters. Most of them came from Europe. They came from Germany. They came from France. They came from all of these countries. And we called them, I called them myself in many cases, I said, Take your fighters. They said, We dont want them. You take them. I said, No, no, no, we did you a big favor. Theyre citizens of Germany. Theyre citizens of France. Theyre citizens of these various countries in Europe. Take your fighters. We dont want them, sir. We dont want them. And I said, How unfair are we treated We do them a great favor, and they wont take the fighters. So were doing some things that are pretty amazing. Every once in a while you have to change course, and do what you have to do. The United States has spent 8 trillion in the Middle East. Weve lost thousands of brave soldiers, and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people, great people, their lives will never be the same. These wars produced only chaos and bloodshed. And all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed, made the Middle East, really its less safe, its less stable, and its less secure. And I say it all the time. The single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going in to the quicksand of the Middle East. We spent 8 trillion and lost thousands of lives. And by the way, the other side, we can talk about that, lost millions of lives. What did we do So were going to pull them out, and were pulling people out, and were trying to make good deals, and were going to bring our soldiers back home, and we may need them for something else, and theyll be ready. Previous administrations lust for regime change, and also put historic Christian communities in vastly more danger than they were before we started. They are some of the biggest victims of these power vacuums and reckless foreign adventures. The Christians, the Christians. And we work hard with the Christians. We have tremendous evangelical support. We work hard with the Christians. So were slowly getting out of the Middle East. Were doing it carefully. And were rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before. When I came into office, a very prominent general told me, because it looked like we could have a big conflict with someone, said, Sir, we have no ammunition. We had old planes. We had planes that were so old, they didnt fly. We had people going to the desert, the plane graveyards, airplane graveyards, picking up parts. I never want to hear a President of the United States hear those words again. I never want to have a President hear the words, Sir, we have no ammunition. Think of that. Think of that. Now, thanks to more than two and a half trillion dollar worth of investment in our military, we have more ammunition, more missiles, more rockets, more tanks, more fighter jets, and more of everything else than weve ever had before. And we have no choice. You look around the world, and we have no choice, unfortunately. And the Democrats want to dismantle our military. After years of building up other countries, we are finally building up our country. Thats what we have to do. Were replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA, a giant victory for our farmers, ranchers, workers in Minnesota. Congress should pass USMCA immediately. We hope that Nancy Pelosi can start thinking about passing some legislation instead of thinking about nonsense. And to protect our industrial backbone, I placed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel. Im also fighting back against years of chronic trade abuse from China. And the supply chain of China, which was unbreakable, is now breaking wide open. And they understand that. And I dont blame China for whats taken place over the last 25 years. I blame the people that led our country that let that happen, where hundreds of billions of dollars a year was taken from our country to build China. Its not Chinas fault. In the previous administration, they put our nations natural resources under lock and key, including thousands and thousands of acres in a place called Superior National Forest. Last year, I traveled to Duluth and announced that we would be ending this injustice, reopening Superior National Forest, and restoring mineral exploration for the iron ore mines of Minnesota. Tremendous jobs. And now the iron range is back in business. The last time I was here, a man came up to me, he said, Sir, President Obama took our heart away, took our life away. Ill never forget it. A man, strong guy, had tears in his eyes. He said, You gave us back our life, because they took it away from him. We gave it back. Best iron ore there is anywhere. My administration is also fighting the Democrat socialist healthcare agenda that would obliterate Medicare. Republicans will protect Medicare, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And for those of you that have private healthcare, health insurance, 180 million people, they are going to end it, obliterate it, and most people are thrilled with it. We are going to leave it. Youre going to have your plan the way you want it. And theres no plan like those plans. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb, right up to the moment of birth. That is why Ive asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant Washington corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and its the party of the American Dream. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. You remember that Gee, Im sorry, Im so sorry. Now you have a President whos standing up for America, we are standing up for Minneapolis, and we are standing up for the great state of Minnesota. We begin this political campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for America. We begin this campaign with right now almost three years of perhaps the most successful administration in the history of our country. Together, we will help millions more citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. With your help, we will reelect, and we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years. Nobody thought that could be done. Going to be done. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work, and the sanctity of life. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our great national motto, In God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist in history. Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put a man on the face of the moon. Proud citizens like the people of Minnesota helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Minnesota, I will tell you this with great certainty, the best is yet to come. Thank you very much. And just in concluding, together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Minnesota. Thank you."
DesMoines,Jan30,2020,"I worked so hard for this state. I worked so hard. You just got two of the greatest trade deals, and add Japan to it, by the way. Lets make it three, 40 billion from Japan, USMCA, all done. China, all done for the farmers. Its done, that I can tell you. Youre going to have to get bigger tractors and a hell of a lot more land. Youve got to produce a lot of product. I dont know if you can, but, hello Des Moines. Its great to be with you. Im thrilled to be back in American heartland with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. Great people. This November were going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats that are right down the street. I mean, I dont even know. I just saw, New York Times, can you believe Failing New York Times When we leave in 10, 14, 18, 22 years from now, the New York Times will be out of business and so will a lot of others. But, did you see they did a New York Times poll, I think, and Sienna, Sienna, New York Times of Iowa, and they have me pitted against every one of the Socialists, and were winning by a lot. Everyone. Were beating them all. Were beating them all. Were beating them all. Were beating them like they havent been beaten before. You know all the noises about their crazy debates, nobodys watching their debates, but its all about their debates. They dont care about the farmer. Everything out here, they love Trump, and you should love Trump with what Ive done. So, were going to win the great state of Iowa and its going to be a historic landslide. If we dont win, your farms are going to hell. I can tell you right now. Sell, sell, theyll be saying Sell. No, we love the farmers, and we love the ranchers, and we love the manufacturers, frankly. You got plenty of that too in this state. The great state, and you have a great governor, by the way. You have a great governor. But every day were achieving extraordinary victories for the citizens of the Hawkeye State. The Iowa unemployment rate has reached an all time low in history. Thats not bad. Thats not bad. Oh, lets vote for Pocahontas. Lets vote for Bernie. Lets vote for sleepy Joe. Hes falling asleep. Joe, Joe, Joe. He always gets the name wrong. How many times has he missed it Hes in Iowa. He says, Great to be in the great state of Ohio. They say, Joe, youre in Iowa. You cant do that. No matter how great you speak. If youre Winston Churchill, if you make that mistake at the beginning of your speech, its over. You might as well just wrap it up. Theres the fake news. They would just absolutely destroy you. They would absolutely destroy you. You cant do that. You cant do that, Joe, sleepy Joe, but you have these guys. You have these people. How about Buttigieg Buttigieg. They call him mayor Pete. You know why Because nobody can pronounce his name. Nobody has any idea. Buttigieg. They say, Say edge edge. He presides over a city thats failed. Its doing so badly, in a state thats having the greatest year theyve ever had, and they have a great governor also, and they had a great governor. You just heard from him, right The great state of Indiana, so I dont see that one. Go down the line. We have some people. Lets not talk about them. What happened to mini Mike Where is he Hes not running. Hes skipping four or five states. Mini Mike. Ive had him up to here. More people are working right now in Iowa than ever before. Now think of it. Think of it. Yesterday we replaced a NAFTA disaster with the incredible brand new U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement. The USMCA, you know when you have a hard time with that one, memory is a great thing. Ive always had a great memory for whatever reason, but memory is a great thing. Having a great memory, but sometimes you take little clues. USMCA. Thank you, darling. I love you, too. Where is that person up Look at that. Wow. What a good, strong voice. But you know how you remember it The song I just walked in on. Theyre playing the song YMCA. So, when youre having a hard time, gee, whats U-S, just think of the song YMCA, and youll remember it, USMCA. Its a massive win for Iowa farmers and workers of all kinds. Its a massive win and it creates some fairness with Canada. It creates fairness with Mexico. Probably the biggest reason that I ran was the unfair trade that Ive seen, and one after one, China, Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea, weve made all these deals, and we have plenty left over. Plenty left over. Europe, Europe, Europe is next. I wanted to finish China before we started on Europe. I like to do them one at a time, one at a time. Im a very organized person. But weeks ago we also signed a terrific new trade agreement with China that will boost American agriculture by 50 billion every year, and many other businesses like manufacturing, banking, finance, overall 250 billion, and you know with the farmers, because I have a place in my heart for the farmers big. I went and I saw Ambassador Lighthizers in charge, hes fantastic. I said, What are you doing Were getting ready for the final deal. What are you doing He said, Im putting in 20 billion. Because I asked Sonny Perdue. Hes great. You know who he is, right Secretary of Agriculture. I said, Sonny, whats the biggest number that Chinas ever done with the farmers He said, Sir, 16 billion last year. 16 billion. This was two years ago. I said, So, 16 billion is the biggest, because you know, they targeted you, and now were friends with China. In fact, maybe weve never had a better relationship and were working with them very closely on the Coronavirus. Were working with them very, very closely. We only have five people. Hopefully everythings going to be great. They have somewhat of a problem, but hopefully its all going to be great. But, were working with China just so you know, and other countries very, very closely, so it doesnt get out of hand, but its something that we have to be very, very careful with, right We have to be very careful. But I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, I said, Sonny, whats the number 16 and 12 the year before, and you were targeted. I dont blame China. Look, theyre smart. Theyre negotiators. They targeted Trump states. Where do they love Trump They love him in Iowa. They love him in Nebraska. They love him in all these states. They love him in Wisconsin. They love him. We won Wisconsin. They like him and Wisconsin, and a lot of the farm states, and they targeted. The farmers came to see me and they said, Sir, you have to do whats right. When the fake news would interview farmers, the farmers would say, No, no, President Trump is doing the right thing. It should have been done years ago. Shouldve been done years and years ago. But you couldnt have made it because there was too much money, 16 billion. So, what I did is I put a 25% tariff on everything coming in from China, 250 billion, and then more tariffs on things beyond the 250 billion market. We took in billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. We still are, and then what happened When I heard about the farmers and I saw the farmers, they were in the White House. They came to see me. I had 36 farmers and I said, Im going to give you. They said, Sir, we dont want anything. I said, What do you mean you dont want anything Ive never heard that before. Everybody wants money. They want every. They said, We just want a level playing field. I never forgot it. They said, We dont want anything. We just want a level playing field, and weve been treated badly for years, for years. I said, Well, you havent been given a level playing field for many, many years, for decades. You havent been given a level playing field. Were going to give you the levelest field that you ever had. But, but in the meantime, Im going to give you 12 billion, out of these tens of billions that were collecting. Dont worry. We had plenty of left over, because we never got 25 cents from China. China took from us. We didnt take from China, right I said, Im going to give you 12 billion for the year before, and Im going to give you 16 billion for this year. That was last year for this year. So, they got, meaning you, a lot of you in this audience, got 12 billion, and you got 16, so you got 28 billion over that short period of time, and you were able to actually, in some cases, I guess thrive. I told Sonny, I want to take care of the small farmer too, not just the big monsters. I want to take care of everyone, everyone. But, I never forgot when CNN fake news and all these people, they go around interviewing the farmers. They could never find anyone saying bad about Trump. Theyd go into diners. What do you think about Trump Isnt it a terrible what hes doing with the trade The farmer would say, No, hes doing what should have been done 20 years ago. Now, you people are going to make so much money. Youre not going to do just, you know what Just relax. Take it easy. Put it away. Enjoy your life. But youre going to make a lot of money. Youre going to make a lot of money. Again, we have never had, because they respect us now, they didnt respect us. We have never had a better relationship with China than we do right now. Its a beautiful story. They respect us. The whole world respects us now. Were respected again. America is respected again. Okay Were fighting for products made in America and grown right here in this great, great state of Iowa. To keep America safe, we have fully rebuilt the United States military. Its now stronger, more powerful, more lethal than ever before. We have all brand new equipment and it was all built in the USA. Thanks to the courage of American heroes, the ISIS caliphate has been totally destroyed and its founder and leader, the animal known as al-Baghdadi is dead. Crazy Nancy Pelosi said, Dont call him an animal. Hes a human being. No, hes an animal. Hes an animal. Two weeks ago, at my direction, the United States military delivered another historic win for American justice. Our brave warriors launched a flawless precision strike that killed the worlds number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. Qasem Soleimani. He was the mastermind of the road side bomb. He loved roadside bombs. When you see your friends and great soldiers of our country and other countries, frankly, walking around, they dont have legs, they dont have arms in some cases. Some cases they dont have both. You see them walking around, or riding around, or the most brave people, these people have the greatest attitude. I go to Walter Reed and I see him and the young man his legs were blown off. How you doing Sir, I want to get back. I want to get back, sir. Ill tell you, the spirit of these people, it may even top the farmers. It may even top the farmers, which is pretty good. But he was responsible, more than anybody else, 90% they say of these roadside bombs sent to fight us, he was responsible and he took a hard hit. He took a very hard hit. He was responsible for murdering and maiming thousands and thousands of Americans, and hundreds of thousands of other people. Not acceptable. Soleimani was actively planning new attacks, but we ended his bloody rampage forever. Yet, Washington Democrats, true, like crazy Bernie and Nancy Pelosi, opposed our decision to eliminate Soleimani, and to save American lives. That had a tremendous impact. While were proudly creating jobs and killing terrorists, Congressional Democrats are consumed with partisan rage, and obsessed with a deranged witch hunt hoax. You know, were having probably the best years that weve ever had in the history of our country, and I just got impeached. Can you believe these people I got impeached. They impeached Trump. The best trade deals, the strongest military, I took care of the vets. We got choice. We got accountability for the vets, accountability. We got all these things and they impeach your President. No, thats not going to work. Watch, just watch. They want to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy, and overthrow the entire system of government. Thats not happening, I can tell you that. Washington Democrats have spent the last three years trying to overturn the last election. Why am I not worried I should worried. Remember Nixon, it was like a dark period, right Its a very dark period. It was like oh, you think about it. Right With Clinton it was not good. They say that with Johnson, it was a long time ago, none of us remember, but they say it was a very dark period. This is a happy period for us. Its a happy period. Its a happy period because we call this impeachment light. This is light. Crazy Schiff. Shifty Schiff. Hes a sick puppy. Hes a sick puppy. But, you know what Today you saw it, I hit my highest poll numbers since I got elected because the American people, and frankly, people all over the world, know its a hoax. They understand it. They know its a hoax, and we have a great party, the Republican party. They know whats going on. They know whats going on and theyre going to treat us very fairly. But, the Democrats are trying to overturn the last election. We will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in 2020. November 3, November 3, mark it off. November 3, mark it off. Was that a great day 2016 November. Remember Hes not going to do well with this group. I did well. Hes not going to do well with that group. I won that group. Hes not going to do well here or there. Even the exit polls, they took it right up. You know what they didnt know about the exit polls When people are leaving, theyre always very accurate. People leave. Who you voted for I voted for Trump. Who you voted for I voted for crooked Hillary. I dont care that shes a stone cold crook. Im voting for her. Who are you voting for Im voting for Trump, or Clinton, or Trump. Theyre always very accurate, but this time something happened. Many people, many I like that idea. I like it. I like it. Wouldnt we like to run against her. whos tougher Her, crazy Bernie, Biden, Buttigieg Who would be the closest Buttigieg. I dont know. Maybe we take another crack at crazy Hillary. Would that be okay She was so easy. Remember that speech so innocently given talking about deplorables. Remember Remember deplorables But you know the only thing I didnt understand, I said, Thats terrible. But she said another word that was worse. Irredeemables. I said, Boy, shows you how good I am at politics, I said, Shes in trouble. She said our people are irredeemable. To me that was worse. Well, it wasnt that word that caught on. It was deplorable. The next day Im speaking, and women are walking around, Im deplorable. Everyones got deplorable. I say, I think she made a bad speech last night. But irredeemable, remember She called them deplorable and irredeemable, and me being so brilliant, I said, I think that irredeemables going to get her. No, deplorable got her. A lot her like lack of ability. Together we are going to win back the House. We are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep that beautiful, gorgeous, incredible White House. People dont realize this is a lot of work. I just left Michigan, and Michigan is booming now because of me, meaning, my people. I say to Prime Minister Abe, hes a friend of mine, Shinzo, Japan, You got to do something. You got these massive deficits for our country. You got to open up plants in Michigan fast, Shinzo. Fast. Youve got to do it. Yes, I will do it. Hell do it, and hes doing it. Countries are coming in from all over the world. Theyre going to Michigan. Theyre coming to Iowa. Theyre buying your stuff again, like crazy, like crazy. Theyre going to Ohio. Theyre going to Pennsylvania. Theyre going to South Carolina. Theyre going to North Carolina. Theyre going to Florida. Theyre coming in like never before. Theyre all coming back. I ran on the issue trade. I ran on a lot of different issues, but trade was one of them. That was so big. To me, it was so big. I used to say, how do we allow these companies to close, fire everybody, go to another country Mexico, wherever it may be, make product, sell the product into our country, pay no tax. Who the hell would allow this to happen Who would allow to happen Its like in South Korea. I went to him, I said, Listen, your deal is no good. We have to make a new deal. South Korea, were protecting them all, all these different things. I said, Number one, youve got to pay us more. They agreed to. They gave us 500 million a year more. They said, But nobody has ever asked. They gave us 500. Thats nothing compared to what they have to do. Thats okay. Thats okay. Theyll pay more. But you know, they made a trade deal with the United States. Hillary Clinton was in charge of the deal, right She said its going to produce 250,000 jobs, and she was right. 250,000. You know who it was for For South Korea, not for us, it was for South Korea. So, we renegotiated the deal, if I have your permission, we renegotiated the deal and now we have a good deal with South Korea, okay This deal is going to produce, remember This deal is going to produce 250,000 jobs for South Korea. She didnt lie. Cant say she lied. She lies about a lot of other things, but she didnt lie. How is she taking her defeat Okay I think so. Remember the debate Do you promise if you lose that you will support the winner and I sort of, I didnt exactly say yes. I didnt say yes, in all fairness, but I got sort of like six the 68% there. But she said, See he wont. Shes the one that doesnt do it. No, no, I feel badly because its too late for her to get in. I kept hoping, but I think, honestly I think that sleepy Joe, crazy Bernie, I dont even want to put Buttigieg in, but I think theyd actually be tougher than her. During this campaign season, the good people of Iowa have had a front row seat to the lunacy and the madness of the totally sick left. This is a radical left people that were dealing with. Todays Democrat party, I dont say Democratic party, it sounds so much better in a speech, right Democratic party, the Democrat, but thats not their name. Its called the Democrat party. You know some people arent allowed to say the Democrat party because it doesnt sound good. I dont even like it. I dont like the way it sounds in this speech, but Im going to say it because Im not looking to have them look good. Todays Democrat party is run by left wing extremists who want to massively raise your taxes, increase regulations, cancel your health plans, raid Medicare, shut down American energy, destroy your social security, they will destroy your social security, eliminate religious liberty, punish free speech, confiscate your guns, abolish your borders, and indoctrinate Americas children with hateful, left-wing ideology. Other than that, theyre okay. Other than that, theyre fine people. In short, this election is a choice between American freedom and Democratic socialism, and in some cases, in my opinion, its worse than Socialism. Socialisms a kind word by comparison. The Democrats will lose because America will never be a socialist country. We cant. Theyre all watching tonight. Theyre sitting in their hotel room, little hotels right down the street, and theyre looking at this crowd. The press never talks about my crowds. Did you see in New Jersey a couple of nights ago We had signups for 175,000 people. We had an arena that held about 9,000 people. We could have sold it out 15 times. Okay They dont talk about that. You know what they talk about They said Donald Trump who spoke before a nice crowd. If Bernie or sleepy Joe has, I mean Joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a round table. No, its true. No, they were in a gymnasium. There were in a gymnasium, and they set up a round table, and people that went there to hear his speech are now being asked, What do you think of socialism They just said, I just want to be here to watch his speech. They set up a round- They just said, I just want to be here to watch a speech. They set up a round table because the crowd was so small, and then theyll say, It was a brilliant round table. It was wonderful. They never mention crowds. They never mention crowds. They never mention anything. Ill tell you, U.S.M.C.A, The biggest trade deal ever signed in the history of the world. Okay It is, wait. It barely got any mention. We signed it. It barely got any mention. They talk about the impeachment hoax. They talk about all the other stuff, but the trade deal, that is going to change our country. Its going to bring growth. Wait until you see, toward the end of next year, the growth will be astronomical because of the China Trade Deal, the U.S.M.C.A, Japan, South Korea, Europe, when that happens. It will happen because they have no choice. They have no choice. But in the papers, and on the fake news cable shows, and the regular, look, NBC is horrible, the NBC Nightly News, its terrible. The good news is people dont watch it like they used to, because they dont believe in it. They dont believe in it. And as Sean Hannity would say, MSDNC, you know what MSDNC is, right, so bad. CNN, total fake stuff. Oops, their camera just went off. Look The camera just went off CNN Their camera just went off. That always happens whenever I say CNN, their camera goes off. But Americans, across the political spectrum, were disgusted by the Washington Democrats, the partisan hoaxes, the witch hunts, the con jobs. Its all a con job. And so, they dont love our country, I swear they dont. You look at Nancy Pelosis district in San Francisco. It was so beautiful, and now its a disgrace, being watched all over the world. Needles all over the place, everything else all over the place. Im not going to get into it, washing down into the ocean, washing down onto their beaches, people living in tents if theyre lucky. I mean you never saw anything, living on their most important entryways into what was a great city, San Francisco. Whats happened And all she does is work on the hoax and work on all of the stuff. Really, these people are very, very bad for our country. We have to take back the House of Representatives, we have to. Registered Democrats and Independents are leaving the Democrat party in droves, and we are welcoming these people, and these great voters, to the Republican Party with wide, open arms. And we are thrilled to be joined tonight by a lot of your great leaders, a lot of your really wonderful people. Im not going to mention all the names, because all those cameras that are rolling, they dont like it when I do it, but one they dont mind is Governor Kim Reynolds. Come up, Kim, come up here Also first gentleman, Kevin Reynolds, Kevin Kim, come on, come on. You want to say something Great, great job. Thank you. Oh, she was driving me a little bit batty. She would call me up, Kim, you would call. What about ethanol I said Kim, I mean, Im doing a lot for that place. No, no. We want ethanol. Then, we want biofuel. Then she is asking for things I never even heard of, but we got them all, whatever that hell she wanted, we got. Right And by the way, Joni Ernst and the great Chuck Grassley are right now in Washington fighting for fairness, fighting the hoax, fighting for all of us. They called, they said, Do you mind if we dont go tonight We have to stay. I said, I dont want you to be there. I want you to be where you are because they are fighting for us. They are great people. They are great people. And, they would call too. Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst, they would call, We got to help our farmers, sir. Yes. Okay, we are going to help the farmer. They were great. Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg. Thank you, Adam. Thank you, Adam. Great job, Adam. Speaker of the Iowa House of Representatives, a man with really fantastic genes, got to have like the best genes in the world. Although you had an ex-governor here that had very good genes, too. We have his son in the audience, too, but this is Representatives Pat Grassley. Those genes, those two young men have the greatest genes anyone has ever had for politics. Thank you, fellas, thanks. I sent one of them, the father to China, and hes now Ambassador to China. Do you think he is happy Is he happy I think so. I think he is happy. Great Governor, longest serving Governor in history, actually, 24 years. We have the Chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, Jeff Kaufmann. Great job. And just quickly, we have the worlds tallest campaign manager, Brad Parscale. And Republican National Committee Co-Chair, who has done an incredible job, Tommy Hicks. And we have the great negotiator, the great man, Bob Lighthizer with us here, someplace. Wheres Bob What a job he did negotiating for you. And we have somebody that you never heard of, somebody thats a fantastic person, but you never heard of, somebody named Sarah Sanders. Have you ever heard of her Come here, Sarah Come on Thats pretty good And we have a great football player, from Iowa, Matt Whitaker is here, Matt. Say something. Thank you, Sarah. Very popular. She is a terrific person, great person. Thanks to Republican leadership, American now has the hottest economy anywhere on the Planet Earth, not even close. Every Prime Minister, President, King, Queen, Dictator, whatever you want to call them, they all say, How did you do it And, the truth is we have certain advantages, but we also have a people advantage. We have the greatest people in the world. I really mean that. Since the election, we have created seven million new jobs. The average unemployment rate, under my administration, listen to this, is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country. Can you believe that The lowest unemployment rate. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded, think of that. More than two million millennials, you know what millennials are, young, great people with a lot of future, they have gotten jobs, and their wages have grown by nearly 5% annually. Thats a record. Another record is that between the ages of 25 and 34, people are now working, and thats a record, the number of people, 25 to 34. And under the so-called Trump Economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of any group. And thats a great thing. This is a blue collar boom, and thats a good thing too. Thats a good thing. Earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% for the first time ever, for the first time ever. And median household income is at an all time high, just for one second, president Bush, eight years, 450. President Barack Hussein Obama, eight years, eight years, 975. President Donald John Trump, two and a half years, not three, because the numbers were taken at two and a half, now its actually higher. Two and a half years, including the tax cuts which are massive, and including all of the regulatory cuts, and the other things you have gotten, 10,000. Think of it. You have eight years, 450. Eight years, 975. Two and a half years, think of it, 10,000. Its one of the reasons the economy is doing so well. And let the people down the road tell you about that, okay Let them tell you about that. And those tractors that I told you to buy, your tractors will be 60 years old if they have anything to do with it. They will be 60 years old. They will be old, tired, exhausted. Your land will be exhausted. You will be exhausted. Weve ended the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth, by far. We are also proudly promoting American ethanol, and I recently approved E15 to be used all year round Biofuel also, but the Socialist Democrats want to shut down American energy. They support Representative Ocasio-Cortez. Its a real beauty. Thats a real beauty. Thats a beauty. I cant even believe it, but I dont want to knock it, because the Green New Deal, which would crush our farms, destroy our wonderful cows. I love cows. They want to kill our cows. You know why, right You know why Dont say it. They want to kill our cows. That means you are next. And they want to wipe out, totally, Iowa ethanol. They want to wipe it out. But we will never let that side get in, and by the way, thats the least of it. But I dont want to attack the Green New Deal, because they might change it. I said to her the other day, they said, What do you think of the Green New Deal I said, Well, it should be studied carefully. We should look at it, look at it closely. I dont want to talk about until about two months before the election. And then I will tell you how totally insane it is. How about this crazy Senator How about this crazy, crazy Senator from Hawaii They said, Im totally in favor, not the smartest. She said, Im totally in favor of the Green New Deal. Well, that would mean theres no more airplanes. Oh They started screaming at her in Hawaii, they said, How the hell are we going to get to Hawaii They said, Were going to build a railroad. She said that would be the worlds longest track. Its the worlds longest. She doesnt know that they dont want airplanes anymore, and yet they fly around in brand new Gulfstreams, in brand new planes all over the place. Theyre flying from place to place. Theyre talking about the carbon footprint. Were going to destroy the carbon footprint What time is my plane taking off, please To lift up forgotten communities, the Republican tax cut launched Opportunity Zones, jobs, and investment, and now rushing into over 60 newly and this is incredible, brand, newly designated Opportunity Zones right here in Iowa alone. Rich people are investing vast amounts of money. Tim Scott, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, came into my office. He said, I have an idea that I have wanted to do for years, but we have never had a president that could pull it off. I said, What is it, Tim And he talked about Opportunity Zones, first time I heard it. And we did it, and there is nothing, nobody has ever seen anything like it. Money is being poured into these communities that would have never been there. Whats happening is incredible. Opportunity Zones. Remember it. For decades, politicians ran for office, promising to protect American farmers and workers. Youve heard it all your lives, right But then, they went to Washington. They looked at those beautiful marble columns, and that gorgeous ceiling painted, and all that gold, the way they used to build the buildings, they dont build them that way anymore. We could, but they just dont know how. By the way, were building the wall. You know the wall is over a hundred miles long. Its over a hundred miles long already and moving fast. They went to Washington and they sold you out. Thats what happened. They sold your jobs out. They sold everything out. Globalist politicians allowed other countries to raid our factories, ravage our farms, rob our workers, and ransack our communities. But the era of economic surrender is over, because now we are finally putting America first, America first. Before I took office, Washington looked the other way, while China stole our secrets from American agriculture. Your business, what they do scientifically, nobody understands what they have done to a seed. It doesnt sound complicated. It is genius, what they have been able to do, what you have been able to do. But those secrets were being stolen, stolen. And installed massive barriers to your exports. You couldnt do anything with exports, so people, not only China, many, many other places were stealing your secrets. Our new agreement with China will protect our intellectual property and pry open vast new markets for American beef, pork, poultry, seafood, soybeans, rice, dairy, and much, much more. But you know it is true. China is so big. 1.5 billion people. We have 350. 1.5 billion people, think of that, and we are just touching it. This deal will be so big. If it all works out, and you have the best product, the best product in the world, if it all works out, it will just keep expanding. 250 billion will end up being much, much more than that. And, Ive told this story before, when we were signing, we were almost finished and I said, How much are the farmers getting Meaning how much are they going to purchase from the farmers. And Ambassador Lighthizer said, We put 20 billion, sir. The highest ever was 16, so we made it 20. I said Make it 50. They said, What And then people, even farm people, said, Sir, we cant produce that much. I said, Thats a good problem, not a bad problem. I said, Make it 50, so we now have, in the contract, from 40 to 50 billion worth of purchase. Make it 50, make it 50 Right, Jared I said, Jared, you better make it 50. I want those farmers to come back, say, Sir, sir, we cant do it. We cant produce that much, sir, what are you doing to us I dont think that would ever happen Do you think that would ever, I said they will figure a way. Hes going Absolutely not. Nah, I said, Dont make it 20, make it 50. The U.S.M.C.A. is another colossal victory for American agriculture like you have never had before. Its time. We suffered for a year and a half, almost two years. Think of it, but not really because I was able to give you those, I wont call them subsidies. I made that mistake once with the farmers. I said to this group of farmers that came in, Subsidy. I used the word subsidy. That was the worst word, Sir, we dont watch subsidy Please dont ever use that word. I said, I wont, I promise. Just in that small, little grouping where you were doing nothing. Its called promises made, promises kept. Promises met. The last time I came, I never did this before, I never ran, so they all said, You never ran before. You cant do this if you never ran, so whatever happened, it happened. One by one, they started dropping out, right And then I was left with one, Hillary Clinton, and that worked out very nicely. He cannot get to 270, remember 270, electoral college. He cannot get to 270. I went to Maine. Its true, Maine, too. Its got one point, right, one. I went there a lot, many times. Everyone said, well, they kept getting me, maybe if I have a great night, 269, but 269 loses. Right But we got 306 to 223. 306, 223, so they were right, You cannot get to 270, you can get to 306, but not that there is In the eight years before my election, net farm income plummeted by 20%, you know that. If you look at a chart, for 15 years actually, not eight, for 15 years, its like a roller coaster ride down for the farmer. Soybeans. Take a look at it all. It was just a one way street. Everybody was ripping off the American farmer. Now youre going to see numbers that are going to be great. Look at even whats happened recently. Its incredible whats going on and I love it, because you deserve it. You suffered a lot, with people that were stupid. They were stupid Under three years of my administration, net farm income has already gone up nearly 50% and will now be rising even faster. What are you going to do You are going to vote for Bernie You are going to vote for Bernie Here I am on the debate stage, Well, net income has gone up for the farmers 50%. Tell me, how the hell do I lose this debate How do I lose And based on the polls, I guess Im not going to lose in this state. I dont think I will lose in any other state either. Because this is really true all over the country. This is happening all over the country, not just Iowa. On no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betrayed the American people than on immigration. Illegal immigration costs our nation hundreds of billions of dollars, drains public services, overcrowds our schools and hospitals, and threatens innocent American lives at a number that you wouldnt even believe. But we have got it closed up, but were getting your people in. You have people that have worked for you for a long time, dont you I know who the people that you have, and they are hard workers. We have a lot of great people. You have a lot of great people out there. Right here in Des Moines, a twice deported, illegal alien was charged with shooting and killing a woman, her 11-year-old daughter, and her five-year-old son. In this region of the county alone, last year, ICE officers arrested nearly 4,000 illegal aliens charged or convicted of heinous crimes, including robbery, rape, and murder. Yet todays Democrat Party glorifies illegal immigration. We have no idea, now we do now, but people would come in by the hundreds of thousands. We have no idea who they are. Many are fine people and all of that, but some are stone cold rapists, and murderers, and people that their countries dont want, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and even Mexico. Right now we have a love affair with Mexico because the Democrats, the Democrats wouldnt give us what we needed and I got Mexico, theyre great. They put up 27,000 soldiers on our Southern border and the numbers are plummeting, 87% down. The president of Mexico is doing a great job. And we ended Catch and Release. You think that was easy Catch and Release, you know what Catch and Release is You catch a criminal, you take the number, and you release him into the, they would never come back. We say, come back please in three years, this is a Democrat deal. Come back if you dont mind, in three years. We release them into our country. We totally ended it through a very, very slick group of rules. Catch and Release. May we please have your address and your phone number Here it is What have you done I got out of jail. Oh, well, welcome to the United States. Please, we have a little information. Okay, and now were going to release you, and in three and a half years, we schedule a court appearance for you. Do you believe, this is the only country in the world. They catch somebody on the border. Youre supposed to be Perry Mason. You take them to court. Other countries catch somebody at the border. They say,  Sorry, you got to get out. We say, Oh, may we have your information Were taking you to court. Man. Todays Democrat Party glorifies illegal immigration, vilifies the heroes of law enforcement, and pledges to dissolve immigration control entirely. They want open borders. They want hundreds of thousands of people to flow into our country. And some of those people, some of those people are stone cold killers. Some of those people, in the caravans, right I came up with that name but they wont give me credit for that. They dont give me credit for anything. They dont give me credit for fake news. Wasnt that my term Now they say, I see CNN, they said, Fake news has reported, no, no, you are fake news, that fake news is you. You are fake news. They turned the term around. They are reporting that fake news is reporting their fake news. Left wing politicians even support deadly sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into American communities. We dont want them. In New York City, the Mayors Sanctuary Policy recently forced the release of a-  the mayors sanctuary policy recently forced the release of a criminal illegal alien charged with assault. After being set free the same criminal raped, brutalized and murdered a 92 year old woman. They wouldnt give him to the ICE warriors. Their warriors. Theyre tough and they love our country. Theyre very tough and they love our country. Theyre taking MS-13 gang members  Theyre about as tough as you get, theyre taking them out of our country by the thousands. By the thousands. Thats a tough job but they love to do it. They love our country. Sanctuary city policies arent just wrong, theyre immoral, and theyre lethal, and they really are something that has to be stopped. They have to be stopped now. Whats happening is a disgrace. Thankfully here in Iowa your great Republican governor, sometimes referred to as Governor Reynolds, signed a state-wide ban on sanctuary cities. Thank you Kim. That is why we need to elect more Republicans nationwide, to end sanctuary cities in all 50 states. Thank you Kim Reynolds. You know I endorsed her, so I want to take full credit for the job she has done. I endorsed her very early, right Very early I endorsed her. I know talent. Shes done a great job. Democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order, and justice. Its true. We are finding the illegal game members, drug dealers, predators, and we are throwing them the hell out of our country, ideally. We dont want to put them in prison because you know what We got to pay for them for the next 50 years, but sometimes we have to. If theyre too dangerous we have no choice. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row, and theyre getting lower, and lower. Shockingly, as that wall gets longer, the crossings get less. Remember the Democrats You dont need a wall. You dont need a wall. You dont need it. Seven years they all voted for it, they just didnt have the ability to build it. You know its not easy with land, and this, and that, and property, and rights. They couldnt figure it out but I can figure it out. The problem was we couldnt get the money, but we got all the money we need now. We have everything. We have everything. The last time, this last budget, they didnt really fight us on the wall. You know why Because they learned its a really bad issue for them. Its a really bad issue. But I made one mistake with the wall. I should have said, We will never ever build a wall. They would have given me so much money to build a wall. That was my only  Because I used to go, We will build the wall, right That was a mistake. I should have said, We will never ever build it. Under no circumstances, and they would have forced its building and I would have said, Okay. By the way, in all due respect, you know whos going to pay for the wall, right No, no, they play  The fake news plays. No, no, through remittance illegal aliens from Mexico are going to pay for the call. Thats what it is. Remittance. 100% because when I say something I mean it. I said I was going to build a wall. You think its easy when you have a party that controls the House, you got to end that. You got to end that. They said they picked up the House in 18 but I didnt run in 18. You know the big difference when you run, 16 I ran, 18 I didnt run. They did, they picked up some seats. I didnt run, but Im running this time and weve got to take back the House. Kevin McCarthy will be a great Speaker of the House. Kevin McCarthy will be a great Speaker, watch. But getting something built when you have a party that controls one of the three, getting it built is  Honestly I dont want to brag, nobody else could have done it. Nobody else could have done it. Its The Real Deal wall. Its the wall that border security wanted. Remember I thought I could just build concrete slabs They didnt want that because you have to be able to see through. I said, Oh come on. This is the expensive version. This is the best version. This is steel, and concrete, and rebar in between. Its really something. Did you see the other day where drug dealers got caught at the top They couldnt get over. We had to get the fire department to get them down. They couldnt get over and theyre like mountain climbers. They got used to climbing. They got caught because you know that panel Thats an anti-climb panel. Its very hot and very tough. Its a very hard panel to climb, the panel on top. Sometimes Id say, Id rather do without that panel, because Im a very visual person. They said, Sir thats anti-climb panel. I said, Oh it is Okay, lets put it on. To hell with it. Its true. Anti-climb panel. The wall is the top of the line. Thats what they wanted. Mostly 30 feet tall. Thats very tall. Thats maximum. Its really doing a big trick. A lot  Wherever we have it  100 miles is all of a sudden a lot, but where you have that its incredible. 99.9%, especially when were watching it. Were watching the sections. Illegal crossings now are down 75% since last spring. The powerful border wall was starting to set. I mean pretty soon well be setting records in speed. Its going up very rapidly. Very rapidly. Youre seeing it all over and its going to be really something. Look, it would be nice if we didnt have to have it. It would be great, but we have to have it. They said, Oh we could have drones. Oh what are you going to do with drones flying around When people are going through your border with nowhere  Theyre going to have drones flying around. They know because they were all for it. They were all for it. Now all of a sudden theyre against, but they want drones. Well were going to have drones too but the drones are policing the wall. In terms of human trafficking, people dont even talk about it. Because of the internet, sadly, the worst in the history of our world. All over the world. Trafficking in women and children all over the world. All over the world. The worst its ever been, but when we have this border it makes it very, very tough for them to come into the United States with women and with children stuffed in trunks in the back of a car. The Washington Democrats have never been more extreme. 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders government healthcare takeover bill. Its a takeover of your healthcare that would strip all of those 180,000 million great Americans of your private coverage. You want that. You got great deals. Youre able to negotiate, youre able to keep your doctor, keep your area, keep your hospitals, keep everything that you wanted. Now they want to take it away. Report to an operating room when you have a cold, okay In your local hospital. I dont think so. 180,000 million people, but Im not going to knock it because I want Bernie to bring it right up to the end and well debate it the day before the election. Okay We are saving your healthcare while Socialist Democrats are trying to take away your healthcare. Sleepy Joe has no idea what hes even  He doesnt even know what hes talking about. Hes so lost. Honestly, that poor guys is so lost. They talk healthcare, she said, Its over for him. It was over for him, actually if you knew him, a long time ago. Now its really over. We are making healthcare better and cheaper. We got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing, which essentially killed Obamacare. We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will, the Republican party. Were stopping surprise medical billing and making everything totally transparent. I signed it already. Everything now is going to transparencies, where hospitals, doctors, everybody has to tell you how much things are costing. Watch those prices come down. Right Right I have an expert on healthcare. He said transparency because its a big deal. Its a big deal. Nobody else would have gotten it done, that I can tell you. Transparency is bigger than healthcare because you will see prices tumbling like you wouldnt believe. People go in for a blood test, they get charged 2,700. Down the road they get the same test for 57. The same exact test. Maybe its better. Maybe its better. Its crazy. When you have transparency its all going to come. You watch. You watch. But this person, a real expert, said, This is bigger than healthcare, and I got it done. Unfortunately it wont really start kicking in until after the election because it takes a period of time. They have certain statutory requirements, et cetera. Well you better let me win. Can you imagine Can you imagine I did transparency, I took the guts, I did transparency and then Im going to watch as somebody else says, Didnt he do a great job for transparency You better let me win because I want the credit for that one. Were buying cheaper drugs from other countries and approving more generic drugs than ever, ever, ever before. We are defending your right to keep the doctor. We are defending your right to keep your plan. Remember Obama 28 times, You can keep your doctor. You can keep your doctor 28. You can also keep your plan. You can keep it. You can keep it. 28 times he lied. We should impeach him. No, he got it on a lie. He got it on a lie, but weve run it much better. But essentially its totally different because of individual mandate. Because that really took the guts out of it and were running it much better. I had a choice, do we run it well or do we run it poorly If we run it poorly everyones going to blame me. If we run it well everyones going to give him credit, especially the fakers back there right But you know what We got to run it well but were coming up with a healthcare that if we win the House we will have the best healthcare of any country in the world, by far. Were fighting the lobbyists and were fighting the special interest, in case you didnt notice. We are serving only you. Thanks to our bold reforms were now offering health plans that are 60% cheaper than Obamacare. Were offering a lot of different things. We have just passed, recently, 10 months ago, Right to Try. I love Right to Try. You know what that is Thats people are terminally ill and they cant use medicine because  Theyve been trying to pass this, almost for 50 years. You cant use the medicine. We have the greatest doctors, labs, hospitals in the world. They come up with a medicine but it has to go through the FDA procedure, right You cant do anything. You cant use it. They wont let you use it. Now I have you sign an agreement, youre not going to sue the United States, youre not going to this, your family, et cetera, et cetera. Very simple. And they can use it. You have no idea the results that are taking place. You have no idea. You have no idea the results. Peoples lives are being  For me it was simple. I said, Wait a minute, youre worried about hurting somebody These people are dying. Theyre terminally ill. Theyre admitting theyre terminally ill and you wont let them use a drug that may work Let the use the drug. And were letting them use the drug and its working in a lot of cases. We have transformed veterans healthcare, including VA Choice. The best. You know I think Im a totally brilliant human being. I think Im the smartest person, so I came up with a plan. Ill never forget, I was in New Hampshire, I came up with this idea because everybody kept coming up to me and saying, Sir its really terrible whats happening with healthcare. Were waiting in line for two weeks, for four weeks, for seven weeks. Honestly people were waiting in line, they werent very sick, they were terminally ill, truthfully, before they saw a doctor. By the time they got to the doctor. So I came up with this incredible plan. Only I could think of this. I said, Heres what you do  Heres what you do, if somebody cant get a doctor quickly, because we have great doctors at the VA. They dont get enough credit. If you cant get to a doctor quickly you go outside, you go locally, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get yourself all better. Right So I went back. I went back and I told my people, Do you have any idea how smart I am Listen to this plan I have. They said, Actually sir weve known about that plan for 52 years we just couldnt get it approved. So I said, Oh thats too bad, I thought it was brilliant, but what I am good at is getting things approved and I got it approved. People are using it and its great. I know the people of Iowa dont care about this but we are making substantial investments in rural healthcare. We are combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. Thats a great thing. Our great first lady is helping us with that. That is such a big thing for Melania. Big, big thing. She is really involved. We will never let the Democrats give away your healthcare to illegal immigrants, especially when we say, Come in. Come in, well give you healthcare. Its one thing they come in and its a rough situation because we all have hearts but when people are saying, like in California this wacky governor he says, Come in, were going to give you healthcare. Were going to give you free education. Were going to give you everything. Were going to give you a beautiful Rolls-Royce. See to show you how fake they are one of the newscasters said, Donald Trump said that the governor of California promised a Rolls-Royce to illegal immigrants. He didnt promise them. This was a lie and a misrepresentation by President Trump. They cant take a little humor. They cant take it. These people are sick. Theyre sick. No. Theyre sick people. Them and Shifty Schiff is a very sick person. He lies awake at night shifting and turning, Shifty. Shifting and turning in his bed, sweating like a dog. How am I going to get him He didnt do anything wrong, how am I going to get him Oh what a sick guy he is. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion. Ripping babies straight from the mothers womb. Right up until the moment of birth. That is why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, Socialism, and blatant corruption. No matter how you cut it, thats what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. You know that, right Abraham Lincoln. Honest Abe. Remember I always said, I can be more presidential than any other past president, other than perhaps Abraham Lincoln when hes wearing the hat, right Because its easy to be presidential but only have about three people in front of me. Be a, Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Is everything okay in Iowa Oh I see, the world is ripping you off. Well theres not a thing I can do about that. Thank you. Good night everybody. Good night. No, we got to do it the right way. Republicans  And by the way, can I be honest Doing this takes far more talent than doing that. Doing that is very easy. This is not easy. Especially when you just left Michigan, and you just left other places, and you got maniacs doing a number on you all the time for three years. You got the maniacs for three years. I think before I came down the escalator with our future first lady I think really they were doing it then. They started even before I came down on the escalator. These people are maniacs, so you have all that. So youre fighting that and youre doing farm bills. We got your farm bill approved by the way. We got your farm bill approved. I dont even mention that because thats massive by any other standard, but its peanuts compared to the USMCA and the China deal, right So I dont even mention it. Anyway, Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed. Its true. Our numbers with African American workers, people, are through the roof. Are through the roof because  Remember I used to say, What do you have to lose Id read the down the worst on crime, the worst on education. They got this, they got that, they got 10 different things, all horrible. One day Im in front of this tremendous group of people and Im reading this list, African American, they have the highest crime rate, they have the highest this, they have the worst education, they have the worst schools, they have the worst  I said, Stay with me, because they were with the Democrats for a hundred years, more. I said, Stay with me. What the hell do you have to lose You know what You know what Remember that Now they have the best employment and unemployment numbers, they have the best poverty numbers, they have numbers that nobody would believe. Theyre doing so great. Its so great to see it. Its incredible. Youth unemployment, African American youth. Its been great. Were asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are a big tent and a big party with big, bold, beautiful ideas for the future. Were what the country was based on originally. It was called greatness. It was called greatness. During National School Choice Week, School Choice everybody, we continue our fight to rescue children trapped in failing government schools. Iowa became one of the first states to pass School Choice. That was over 10 years ago. Now Governor Reynolds, Senator Ernst, Senator Grassley, and more than 100 members of Congress are supporting our plan to give School Choice to every child in America who needs it. Its a great plan. To give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed criminal justice reform. Think of that. Think of that. We had a lot of great Conservatives who wanted it, we had Liberals who wanted it. They couldnt get it passed. President Obama couldnt even come close. He didnt try too hard. He talked like, Oh Ill try. To uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 federal judges, a record, who will interpret The Constitution as one. And two great Supreme Court justices, by the way. As part as  Right Two great ones. As part of my commitment to rebuild our military we secured an 8.5 million facility to support our Iowa Guardsmen at Camp Dodge, right here in Des Moines, Iowa. Right here, Camp Dodge. Camp Dodge everybody. We take care of Camp Dodge. I recognized Israels true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Yesterday we just released a historic new plan for peace. Were going to see if we can get that done. Its one of the toughest deals of all. One of the toughest deals but we have a shot at it. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for our country. They apologized. They would say, Im sorry. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Iowa. We are standing up for Iowa. At stake in our present battle is the survival, frankly, of our nation. Look, I can make this speech really short. All I have to do is say, Hello Iowa, you have no choice. You have to vote for me. Otherwise everything that youve built in your entire life will be gone. Goodbye Iowa, have a good time. Instead I work my ass off up here, okay Yeah. True. Do you think this is easy Its a little hot in this room. This room wasnt designed for this many people. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020. We have to. By the way, for those beautiful farmers that want to leave your small farms or businesses to your children  Because of our great tax bill, the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, the biggest that you benefit by. Because of that there is no death tax or inheritance tax, as they call it. So I always say, If you love your children thats a great thing. If you dont love your children dont leave it to them and that particular tax wont matter, but if you love  Is there anybody here that does not love your children Is there anybody here who loves your children Well its Iowa. Its Iowa. You love your children. You know you have no tax to pay, you leave your ... No, its great. So when youre looking down at your children youre saying, Oh did you get lucky Did you get lucky Look at them, theyre enjoying life. But only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. That swamp is bad. That swamp is bad. I had no idea it was going to be this sick and this degenerated. Its a degenerate swamp. I had no idea. When I came out, I said, Were going to drain this swamp. I had no idea that the swamp was that evil, but were winning. Were winning because were in The White House. Were winning. With your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependents to independents, and poverty to prosperity. Thats whats happening all over our country. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. Its already happening. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products made, raised, farmed, and grown right here in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine. Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years. Weve already started. Should have been started in the last administration. Incredible. Should have been started earlier, but we started. In less than 10 years, the AIDS epidemic will be eradicated, will be gone. Who would have thought that was possible When they came in and told me that a couple of years ago, I said, Really Nobody knows that. Incredible the strides that weve made. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. In the state of Virginia they want to take your guns away, you believe it Virginia, I love Virginia. Of all states, they want to take your guns away. The Democrats. Not going to happen. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We are one great America. We support, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that family and faith, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way, not government bureaucracy. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, in God we trust. We live by those words, in God we trust. From Cambridge, good old Cambridge. Whos from Cambridge here please Cambridge. What the hell do I mention it for when theres two people here Can I say it anyway Ill say it anyway. Good place Cambridge. Good, he said its amazing. Well, from Cambridge to Council Bluffs, from Cedar Rapids where I made my last speech prior to the election. What a place, 32,000 people. I said, Im going to win tomorrow. To Rock Rapids, from Melbourne to Moorhead, and from Davenport to right here in Des Moines, Iowa. We stand on the shoulders of true red blooded American heroes. This great state was founded by tough, tough, tough frontier men. These are tough people. Lets see how big and how tough. Theyre tough. Anybody like to join ICE You want to join ICE He says, No thank you. And strong pioneer women who defied the dangers to carve out a life and a beautiful home with great families and great neighbors. They tamed the wilderness, braved the elements, tilled the soil, planted the fields and help make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped to build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, where it has always belonged. Its coming back to you, you see that. With your help, your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working and we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before and ladies and gentlemen, and especially the great ladies and gentlemen of Iowa, the best is yet to come. True, true. Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Iowa. Thank you. Thank you."
Latrobe,Sep3,2020,"So thank you Pennsylvania, very much. Im thrilled to be in Latrobe, the home of the late, great, my friend, Arnold Palmer. What a great guy he was. What a great guy. Thank you very much. 61 days from now, were going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and we are going to win four more years in the White House. Joe Biden wants to surrender your jobs to China. You know that. His son walked out with a lot of money for doing nothing. He wants to surrender your nation to the radical left wing mob. Hes trying to change now. We say thats not working because were going up and hes dropping like a rock in water. And before the China virus, this election was over. Now I had to go back to work and weve done a great job on it. We dont get the credit. We dont get the credit. We made a lot of governors look very good. But I will keep your jobs in America, and Ill bring rioters, looters, violent extremists, anarchists, we will bring them to justice. Thats what were doing right now. We have over 400 right now under arrest. These are bad people. Over the last three and a half years, weve secured Americas borders, fixed our broken trade deals, rebuilt the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, secured American energy independence, and built the single greatest economy in the history of the world, and now were going to do it again. Have to do it again. Have to do it again. Got to do it again. And its happening. You see whats happening. Job numbers, retail sale numbers, theyre all at records. Its happening. Its happening very fast. Its actually happening in a super V, not a V. Its a super V and youll see that, and big numbers are coming out and have come out, and just watch your set or watch your newspaper. Read your newspaper. Youre seeing numbers that, congressmen, we havent seen those numbers ever before, actually. Weve never seen them. And by the way, we have record stock markets. We have record everything. Youre going to have an incredible economic year next year. Your stocks are going up. Your 401s are through the roof. I had a little pause today. People wanted to take some profits and probably somebody said something stupid along the way. But the stock markets at record levels. Think of it. In the hopefully rounding the turn on the pandemic, were rounding that turn, and vaccines are coming along great. The job that theyve done, the doctors, everybody else, were years ahead of schedule. Anybody elses President, you wouldnt be talking about vaccines for two or three years from now. Ill tell you right now. That I can tell you. Biden will never be able to protect your jobs or your family. He is a puppet of the socialists, Marxists, and the cop hating extremists. And they are cop hating. And we love our law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. And by the way, I dont know if you saw this, if theres any way of you seeing it, we have thousands of people behind this hangar, thousands, and were trying to get them in. And Id love to get them in. I mean, its an airport. Let them go to the runways. Okay Let them in. I mean, literally there, we landed. I actually thought that was the crowd. Were doing the hanger thing now because the arenas cant do it because of the pandemic for a while, a little while. But in certain ways, I like this better. I dont have to travel. I get off the plane. I make a speech. I get the hell out of here. No, these are great. Do you remember the last days before the campaign Id do a lot of them a day. Get off that plane. It was a little different plane. It was black and white instead of the blue and white. But we had some time. And that was an important day and that was an important year, 2016. But I will tell you, the election that we have coming up is the single most important election in the history of this country. And we had a level of enthusiasm, I mean, even look today. With all going on, look at the kind of crowds we have. But we had record enthusiasm in 2016. By the way, was that greatest evening ever November. And now its going to be November 3rd, and well keep it going and well get it all like a tree. You move that tree. It takes a little while to plant, your tax cuts. Theyre going to raise your taxes. Theyre going to take away your guns. Really, if you look. And you know, theyll criticize me for saying this, the fake news media, which is back there, with their fake polls. The same as last year. We could just put it all on tape. The fake polls, the fake everything. You know, theyre called suppression polls. Theyre meant to make you depressed. Are you depressed You dont look depressed. We have the real numbers. Were leading everywhere. We are leading everywhere. Ill tell you. I think were way ahead of what we were four years ago, and theres far more enthusiasm. Our base is bigger. Its stronger. And weve done the greatest job. Again, if we didnt get hit by the plague from China, between us, I would have canceled, Mr. Congressman, most of the rallies. I wouldnt have needed a rally. Thats a little bit unfair, but thats okay. Thats what Chinas done to our nation. Theyve screwed us for a long time on a lot of different ways. Never has anybody ripped off our nation like China, and Ive taken in billions and billions of dollars. We never took in 25 cents from China. And I gave 28 billion, right, 28 billion to the farmers because they were targeted unfairly by China. And our farmers are very unhappy. I dont think we have too many farmers in this wonderful Pennsylvania town. I know we have a lot of boilermakers over there. We got a lot of boilermakers, Ill be talking about them. Look at those guys. Nobody going to mess with them. Ill tell you. Were going to be talking about them in a minute. But for the entire summer, Biden was silent as far left rioters viciously attacked law enforcement in Democrat run cities all, burned down businesses, terrorized civilians, and just recently marched through the streets chanting, Death to America. This is what we have. Death to America. And by the way, we could end it like immediately. You saw what we did in Wisconsin. It ended. It took a while for the governor. You know, they have to ask us in. Its like, otherwise we have to do something much bigger and its totally unnecessary. The National Guard is fantastic. I went to see them two days ago. Biden went there today. There was nobody there. There was nobody there. He was a little late. I was going to say, Hey, listen, we ended that problem. But we could end it in Portland. Wise guys in Portland. Anarchists. Theyre agitators. Theyre looters. Ill tell you we could end it in Portland in a half an hour. We did it in Seattle. We told them were coming in. You either end it or were coming in. Congressman, we were going in the next day. We were all set. I was actually disappointed, to be honest. They ended it in Seattle. They took over 20% of the city. Do you believe this And the mayor said, No, its going to be a summer of love. These people are crazy. So we end them very quickly. We end them very quickly. And now what were doing is were holding back funds for cities that dont know what theyre doing, where they allow crime to run rampant. And we put a 10 year prison sentence at anybody that knocks down a statue. I took out an old ordinance, a very old one, because today in Congress, you dont get things like that today. They think that you should just have no cash bail. They do the no cash bail. You kill somebody. Theres no bail. Dont worry about it. Go out. But I took out an old ordinance. I gave a new executive order. It says 10 years in prison. And amazingly, amazingly, that was three and a half months ago. And they were having a big march on Washington, march elsewhere, and amazingly, that was the end of the statues coming down. No statutes. And were actually prosecuting people for having done it. We made it retroactive to the beginning. Terrible. Terrible. And by the way, the state statues and monuments, they have to do the same thing. Its real easy. But the rioters that want Biden to win, they want him to win because their agenda, its what they want. Its the craziest thing Ive ever seen. They both want to cut funding for police. They want to end that cash bail. They want to hire far left prosecutors and judges, and let the criminals run wild. The radical left District Attorney in Portland, Mike Schmidt, his name is, has released hundreds of rioters that announced that anyone arrested for interfering with police officers, disorderly conduct, criminal trespass, rioting, and other offenses will not be prosecuted under any circumstance. Oh, its worse. Its worse. You have somebody in Philadelphia whos worse, right Worse. In his manifesto with Bernie Sanders, thats what it is, Biden agreed to all these things. You notice now, No, no. I never said about fracking. I never said. If you dont do fracking in Pennsylvania, 900,000 jobs and your energy bills will triple. Other than that, I dont think you should have it. Okay No, but he said in the manifesto, plus he said many times, we put on the clip yesterday where he, no fracking, no this, no that, I mean, no guns. How about guns No guns. No second amendment. Biden has pledged to a point prosecutors who extend these insane far left policies nationwide. Thats what hes done. Thats called the manifesto. He agreed to all this stuff. The craziest thing, youre supposed to bring it to the right. He actually brought it further left. Bernie never dreamt that this was possible, crazy Bernie. Do you know crazy Bernie I had a lot of his voters come to me four years ago, a big percentage. You know why Because I agree with him and he agrees with me on one thing, trade. The trade. Because he knew that other countries are ripping us off and so did I. Nobody else got it. Especially Biden never got it. He never got it. Still doesnt get it. Now he really gets nothing. I tell you. He didnt get it in prime time. Now he really doesnt get it. But its okay for them to make every city look just like Portland which is a disaster. And again, we could clean it up. We just go right through it. 5,000, 10,000, right through it. These guys are tough. Theyre smart. And they love our country. They love our country. Well clean it up in one half hour. Itll be over.  strength. They dont understand. Nice. They chased him out of his home. Unbelievable. Bidens plan is to appease the domestic terrorist. And my plan is to arrest them and prosecute them. And I will always defend law abiding citizens. Thats why the rioters are voting for Biden and the law enforcement people, you know, we have it from everybody. We just got the sheriffs in Florida, all of them, all of them. We got Ohio. We got Texas. We got North Carolina. We got South Carolina. We got everybody. I see Rick Perry right there. Rick Perry, what are you doing here, Rick Rick Perry, one of the greats. But theyre all voting for me. This election is about safety and this election is about jobs. Today, Im delighted to accept a very, very special endorsement from people I like. Sort of grew up with these people. I dont know what it is, the relationship we have with all of us, with all of us. What Im endorsing, Im getting an endorsement tonight from some very, very special people. They work hard. They do great. We really put them back to work because this state was in trouble. At last year, you had the single greatest economic year in the history of your whole operation, right Of your whole operation. Youve never had anything like that. This has been your greatest. This has been prior to the plague coming in. Its been the Commonwealths greatest. Can we ever call the Commonwealth a state You have two places. But you always have to say, well, wait a minute. Is this one a Commonwealth Two places. You know what the other place is Name it. Huh Thats right. How did you know that, Congressmen Huh But this Commonwealth, its a great Commonwealth. Its a great place. And the boilermakers, local union, its Local 154 of the boilermakers. They chartered in Pittsburgh 125 years ago. None of you were around to see it, and it now represents members in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. And I want to thank John Hughes and the boilermakers here today. Its a great honor to have you. Wheres John Where the hell is John Stand up, John. John, we appreciate it. We appreciate it. Do you know why John is the head You know why Because look, hes got the worst location. I say, Wheres John Im looking in the front row. Put up your hand, John. Look at that guy. Hes great. Youve got my vote, John. Hey, boilermakers, thank you. What a job you do. Youre the heart of this country. You really are. Thank you very much. Thats a great endorsement. Thats a great endorsement. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years shipping Pennsylvania jobs to China and foreign nations. And Ive spent the last four years bringing them back home and were bringing them back home. Bringing a lot of things back home. I ended the last administrations eight year pure war on Pennsylvania oil, and coal, and fracking. If you look at the natural gas, what theyve done to this state, what they were doing to this state. It was sort of easy. I just opened it up and I said, Do it. And the investment put into Pennsylvania, the investment put into the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has been record setting. But again, you had the greatest year youve ever had last year prior to the virus. Youre going to be set. Now with what were doing, I believe that this next quarter, which will be announced, interestingly, just prior to the election, so Im putting myself on the line, but I know whats going to happen. The numbers are going to be great. And next year is going to be one of the greatest years not only for Pennsylvania, but for the entire country. So Joe Hiden, we have a new one, Joe Hiden. We call him Joe Hiden. I have all. What do you like better What do you like better We got a number. Lets do a little poll. Can we do a poll I saved myself so much money. You know, I saved myself so much money. We do these polls with thousands, and those people are coming in from the back, are they not Yes Theyre coming in. Im telling you wouldnt have believed it. Im landing. I wasnt waving at you. I was waving at them. Theres more. But I do these polls. Right And its like a perfect poll. Do you ever see the companies You give them a million bucks and they do a poll, like 78 people were polled. Now youve got thousands of people. So tell me. Whats your feeling, first of all in the name You like MAGA, Make America Great Again Yes Oh, you are the one. You are a man. I made you famous today. You said the nicest things about me. Thank you. Did you see him on television today I think youre great. I think youre great. Thank you. No, he called me a great Christian and a great Christian leader. Thank you. But he did say I wasnt perfect, but thats okay. I said thank you, anyway. Right No, that was really great. That was really great. Biden- No that was really great. That was really great. But if you look at it, the things theyve done, were going to go through a couple of different polls as we go along because I love the people saying do this or do that. But one of the things I got you out of is this thing sounds so good but its so bad. Its a rip off of our country. The so-called Paris Climate Accord. Its a disaster, a death sentence. Its a death sentence for your energy jobs. I took it out. I withdrew from that calamity. Biden pledged to reinstate it. Its going to cost you billions and billions of dollars. You know what it really is Its a way of really taking advantage of the United States. This is what it is. Last year I visited the Shell Petrochemical Plant in Beaver County. Anybody ever hear of Beaver County The largest investment in your states history, all made possible by our pro-energy policies. Biden would wipe out that entire industry killing the jobs of more than 600,000 Pennsylvania workers. Its probably 940,000 they say. Think of that. Also, prices and everything else. Now Biden today came out and said, No, no, frackings okay, its okay Did you see that Frackings okay. Because he was getting killed. And now we came out in favor of law enforcement. Look at all these handsome cops here. And a beautiful cop. If you would see how beautiful, if you would see how beautiful this is, it was like this perfect evening, the sun was setting, the faces of these great, great majestic heroes of our country, right Heroes of our country. And they want to blow Mount Rushmore. But how about this one The Democrats yesterday came out with a plan. Did you see it Now, theyre the DC Democrats. They want to change the name of the Washington Monument, perhaps take it down. Thomas Jefferson, pretty good Thomas Jefferson, right You could forget about ever hearing that name again. Abraham Lincoln, you could forget about it. They want to take down all statues, all monuments in Washington. We have some of your greatest people right here. Let me not even talk to the congressmen. The heck with the Congressman, the boiler makers. How do you like How do you like the idea of taking down our statues to our great George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, all of them I dont think the boiler makers. Youll do a ring around Washington right Along with Christopher Columbus. Hes in big trouble Ill tell you. Except there was one, there was a group of great Italians in New York, they tried to take down. They tried to take down Christopher Columbus statue in New York. You saw what happened, right These Italians formed a little circle. They said, Come on. The agitators decided to leave. Lets get out of here darling. They protected Christopher Columbus. The Italians, now the Italians arent big on taking down Christopher Columbus. You take down those statues you can forget about the Italian vote. Do we agree But they protected it. When asked at the debate if there would be any place for fossil fuels, including coal, and fracking, and natural gas, and so many things that really fire up these big plants where many of you work, and they produce just millions and millions of jobs throughout our country, Biden said, No, we would absolutely not allow anything like that. We would make sure its totally eliminated. Thats what he said. He said, We would make sure its totally eliminated or eliminated. Now hes coming and saying, This isnt working too well. This isnt working. And I made a speech a week ago in Texas. We had crowds that were unbelievable, on the highways, you cant get in, but the highways, its like incredible. You could sell your ticket tonight for a lot of money, go to eBay. Even as a used ticket, you could probably sell. But you go down the highways and you see it, and I was thinking of Texas, Im making a speech in front of obviously people that like oil, they like God, and you know what else they like, they like their Second Amendment, right So think about it. So whether its Pennsylvania, or Texas, or Oklahoma, or North Dakota, or any place, you take a look at this, right And no oil, no guns, no God. I dont think George Washington running with Abraham Lincoln as his VP, hell pick Abraham Lincoln as VP is going to win in Texas, or in Pennsylvania, or any place else with those three things eliminated. Thats what they want to do. They want to take away your Second Amendment. If I werent president, you would either have an obliterated Second Amendment or it would be gone entirely. I am standing between them and your Second Amendment. And thats it. Thats it. They know. We put Baido in charge of guns. Baido is in charge, he wants to get rid of everything. Baido, thats a beauty. Remember he said, I was born for this. Anybody that says theyre born for this. Remember Baido He was on the cover of a magazine, I wont mention the magazine, theyre back there. Its a total phony magazine. But he was on the cover of the magazine. And he said, I was born to run for president. He was born for it. I was born. Anybody that gets that character. That was when he was doing well. Since then hes cratered. Ever since he made that statement, hes looked very bad. But take a look at what he says about guns, and he got put in charge of guns. So I guess Biden pretty soon hes going to be coming out saying, No, no. I never said that. Check out all of the statements hes made on everything and now hes going the opposite way, but hes agreed to the manifesto entirely so maybe hell do that. And then he figures later on, hell go. But everything he said is right, because he has no control over whats happening. The radical left has captured the party. They even elected a person that nobody ever heard of, a senator, its been a while, against a young, good looking Kennedy by 10 points in Massachusetts. Did you know Kennedy lost in Massachusetts You know why Because he wasnt a radical left. He was like a semi-normal person, just slightly left. No, but think of it. This is whats happened. And this is really whats happened. If youre not a radical lefty, meaning guns, meaning fossil fuels, they want wind, wind. To make the windmill, which are made mostly in China, and in Germany, by the way, to make it, so much emission is let out, that is more than you can ever save. Its just the craziest thing. Also, I am truly an environmentalist, but you have to understand. When we do things and they dont, and we clean, and its very expensive to do that and they dont, and we have this massive planet, and China, India, Russia, Germany, all these places, its fuming up and were doing our job and beautiful. No, they have to do it also. Otherwise, it just doesnt work the way its supposed to. They want to ban straws. Has anybody ever tried those paper straws They are not working too good. Right They want to ban straws, I said, well, Ive had a couple of meals at McDonalds, et cetera over the years, right Wendys, a friend of mine owns Wendys, Ill give it a plug, right Burger King. So they want to ban straws. I said, Oh really What about the carton What about the plate What about the knives and the spoons that are plastic Oh, theyre okay, but the straws we got ban. Has anybody ever tried, seriously, the new straw, its made out of paper, right It disintegrates as you drink and if you have a nice tie like this tie, this would have no chance. By the time you get finished, the straw is totally disintegrated. Does anybody walk around with a plastic straw Because its that bad. You whip it out, boom, boom. You never had to do that. When asked whether he would be willing to destroy the jobs of hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers to push his anti-energy agenda, you know what the answer is, right Its the Green New Deal, right This Green New Deal. This was made up by people that dont get it. Either that or people that just dont like our country very much. But Biden replied yes, hell get rid of those jobs. And he famously told a voter, I want you to look in my eyes, when hes not wearing the mask because Ive never seen a man that liked their mask. Look, Im all for it, we have a big weekend, distance on the weekend, and all of that stuff, and wear your mask when youre close together in particular, and wash your hands, all those things. We have Labor Day Weekend coming up. But did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him And then he makes a speech and he always has it, not always, but a lot of times he has it hanging down. Because you know what It gives him a feeling of security. If I were a psychiatrist, right Id say, This guys got some big issues. Hanging down. Hanging down. Congressman, give me your mask. I want to have it hanging from my ear. I dont want to touch your damn mask. Mike Ill never touch your mask. No, but the new one is, I went for a physical, the doctor said to me, Sir would you like to go over to Walter Reed Its incredible. By the way, the job they do on people that have been just really hurt, our heroes. The job they do is incredible. Sir would you like to go over and do a physical You have some time. You know why I had time Some deal, oh, it was China. I decided not to see China because I didnt like the way they were doing business, okay Does that make sense So the doctor, White House doctor, highly respected, Sean, Sean Conley, Sir would you like to go over and do your physical, or do a piece of it, or finish it or whatever it was, but do a physic. I said, I dont know. Im not in love with the idea. Well, if you do it, you dont have to do Okay. Lets go. Come on. So we went, we went, and were driving. Now you have to understand, theyre like a hundred cars. You see what happens here. Its like the plane times 50. So the cars are driving all over to about a 20 minute drive and we get to the hospital, I get out. I was there probably for an hour and a half, two hours. And then yesterday I read that I had strokes. CNN, fake news CNN right there. No, its true. Mini strokes they called them. I dont know what a mini stroke is, but its not good. And there could be a day and Ill admit, I said Hey, it happens all of us. Right Except these young ones. Its never going to happen to them. And Id look at it at that, but you know what happens But nothing happened. So I went in, I did that part of the physical. The end result was hes very healthy. They were very unhappy when they heard that result. What you dont remember is when this took place, it was a long time ago. They just started up because they want to try and get me to be in Bidens physical level. They view me as being somebody thats, I go around, hey, last week, this week, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, South Carolina, back to Washington. Lets go here, lets go there, lets go everywhere. Meetings all the time. I think Ive answered more questions from these maniacs than any president in history. And mean questions. I watched Biden yesterday, so he hasnt answered questions in what, two months or something. And yesterday he took a couple and they were set ups like Ive never seen. One young woman who I think is there, one young woman is smiling, Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi. I just like to ask you, Im sorry to bother you with this question. Its the most incredible. So the doctor wrote a letter saying, No, this rumor is wrong. And I dont like, rumors like that. And by the way, if it were a fact, its fine, it should. I think its an important thing. But if its not true, my wife was like, she came to me, she said, I think I would have known that. I said, Yeah, I think they would have known it too, because they drove back with me. The press follows me, they have a special deal, and then they followed me and then we go in, we go out. But if you remember, last time, I go in, I spend a little time, a physical like we all have. Hopefully you have them. Good thing to have I guess, as long as they give you a good answer. If they give you a bad answer dont bother, possibly too late. But I go in, I come out a couple of hours later I guess, whatever it is, its a short time later, I get into the car, the press sees me get into the car. On my way home, I get a call from my wife, the First Lady whos very popular. Do we like our First Lady Very popular, great person, great woman. She said, Darling, are you okay I go, Why do you ask She said, Theyre reporting that you had a heart attack. Now you have to understand Im driving in a car, which is about what Six cars in front of the press, because they have a big car. Theyre a lot of them and we try and give them as little room as possible, make it uncomfortable. But theyre right behind me. So they know I got in and CNN reported that I had a heart attack. That was the same visit, and that didnt work. No its unbelievable. CNN reported I had a heart attack so my wife was concerned. I said, No, not that I know of. And if I did, I think Id be back there. No. Ill be home in 15 minutes, darling. Thank you for caring. Its always nice. Its always nice. She sounded relieved. Thats good. When your wife sounds relieved. But she said,  I wonder how that happened. Why did they do that Because theyre fake news. So I go in and that rumor lasted for a little while, like a day or two. It lasted for a little while, no matter what I did. Im in the same motorcade, I go in, and I go out. They know Im in the motorcade, I actually have to report it, but Im in the motorcade, and they said I had a One of them said it was a massive heart attack. Think of it. Again, it could happen someday, okay And when it does, I hope things work out. But they knew Im in the motorcade and yet they reported it anyway because they fake news. Now for the same visit, that was the stupidest thing. From now on, when I go for a physical or something or go to the hospital, announce it because this was a quick thing. The doctor, he got me in a lot of trouble. Hes a great doctor. I said, No more surprise visits to the hospital where we do a little work because we have some time. So now the same visit they started yesterday because some joker from the New York Times whos a third grade reporter writes a book and he said, The vice president was prepared to take over the reins because they thought the president was going to go, I guess, under anesthesia. Do they still call it In the old days they called it anesthesia. Its essentially the same thing. I dont want to get into a situation like where Biden used a record player. Remember that You go home, you turn on your record player. But the anesthesia. And I said, How could that be So remember, this is the same visit, same visit. They said heart attack a long time. All of a sudden out of this book. And he said, Suffered mini strokes. Now they get a letter from the White House doctor that said its totally false, totally false. But they still go with it, they go with it. And they know Im in the group with them coming back. And I dont know much about a mini stroke, but I assume Mr. Congressman, if you have a mini stroke, youre not heading back to the White House, right At least youll spend a couple of nights at that great hospital, right So anyway, these are really dangerous people. They are so bad for our country. If we had honest press, it would be so great for the USA. It would be so great. Theyre just a bunch of phony people. Not all of them. You have some very good ones, like about 10%. No, you have some very good ones, you have some great journalists, they know its phony stuff. Theyre doing anything they can to get this sleepy guy into the White House and I just dont think the public is going to fall for it. I dont think the public is going to fall for it. In his best days, 25, 30 years ago, he was weak. He was weak. As a Senator, he was weak. He was not known as being one of the smart ones and now its not exactly primetime, I can tell you that. I just want to announce tonight because were joined with some very, very special warriors and Dan Meuser, Dan, thank you very much. Great job youre doing. Dan, Congressman. Hes a Congressman who have really been warriors for me. You really have been. Thank you very much Dan. Fred Keller, Fred, thank you. Great job, Fred. The great John Joyce. Great, thank you, John. Guy Reschenthaler. Do you know him Guy Reschenthaler. what are you doing over there What happened You dont get along with these guys Oh, okay. Thats good. Now I understand. Thats good. Glenn Thompson. Great job, great job Glenn, really great. And a real good friend of mine, right from the beginning, right, Mike We were in Pennsylvania and a friend of ours, a Congressman, longterm, right From Kentucky. No, from actually Tennessee came up to us, I was getting ready to make a speech, and Tennessee is very early voting. Remember what he said This was four years ago. He said, I dont know whats happening in Pennsylvania. I dont know whats happening in the rest of the country. But if whats going on in the rest of the country is like whats going on in Tennessee He said, Theyre coming from the Hills, the roadsides, the rivers. He said theyre coming, people that never really cared to vote, theyre great Americans, but they never wanted to vote for the people that they were seeing. He said, Theyre miles long. Theyve got Trump here, Trump hats, Trump pins, right Tennessee. Duncan, Congressman Duncan, right Remember that Mike That was the first time. I mean, they said that theyd never seen anything like it. Tennessee has been incredible by the way. So Mike and I listened and we said, I wonder what thats all about. But it is true. People that werent really political people, theyre coming in, and the deal here, like the Miss Universe, good old Miss Universe, right Like this, they came with hats, they came with pins, theyre loaded with pins. One person had hundreds of pins. They never wouldve had a pin in their life, but they love the job that weve done and were going to do it even better in the next four years. Another great friend of mine whos a tough cookie and a great Congressman. But unfortunately hes a former because hes just, I dont know., Hes just a special guy and really has a big, beautiful heart, Lou Barletta, Lou. You look good Lou. Why dont you run again Lou And a man who is tough. Theres this guy. You ever hear of a guy named Conor Lamb Hes like a lamb. So we heard, because hes in sort of a Trumpy area, right And we heard that hes going to be for Trump, but hes going to be fighting for Trump. I saw some of his commercials, I thought he was a Republican, right Except when he got to Washington, he voted with Pelosi a hundred percent of the time. Craziness. He voted with craziness. And so we thought, this Conor lamb guy, he even voted to impeach your president over nothing. Zero. Zero. And thats very personal. When they do that, thats personal. And I have to say congressmen, 196 to nothing they stuck with us and so did the Senate other than Romney. You can have Romney I think. Remember he was walking with the Black Lives Matter saying, Yes, Im a member of Black Lives Matter. Everyone said, Thats nice. Wonderful. He had a lot of mask on, Ill tell you that. But we did a great job, it was an amazing thing. But this Conor Lamb was out there fighting it, and he shouldnt have done that. And we have somebody that blows him away. Hes more of a hero, hes tougher, hes stronger, hes smarter, hes better looking, not that, that matters. Under the me too generation, I dont talk about looks anymore. Looks dont matter. Doesnt make any difference. I dont talk about looks. Me too. Me too generation. But Ill tell you, this man is something special. Hes a real hero, a real tough guy, and hell never let you down, Sean Parnell. Just remember that Conor lamb, and I remember, because hes like a lamb, hes like a little lamb. Weak, got a lot of weak people. We like strong people, dont we We like strong people. We need strong people right now. We have somebody else in the audience who served as my Secretary of Energy and he was incredible. He was the Governor of Texas for what 12 years I think. Rick right 12 Tell me. 14 14 years he was. And he was an incredible governor, and he was an incredible secretary, and hes been an incredible friend. Rick Perry everybody. There was nobody that got into the race tougher than Rick. What he said about me, Ill never repeat again. Even my own family didnt like me when he got finished. And when he decided that I would be the one, he got out and theres nobody thats said better things about me. But youre great Rick, and you did a fantastic job. Every place youve been, youve been great. Thank you very much. Rick Perry. Thank you. Hey Rick, how are we doing in Texas 00, the polls closed and they only announce if youre way ahead. So they say, The polls have closed in the great state of Texas, Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas.  Hillary even beat this guy. Hillary. Hillary came in second in Utah. This week my administration reached a breakthrough agreement to stop additional steel imports from Brazil and from Mexico for the rest of the year despite the USMCA, sometimes they get a little carried away and we have to do a little tariff action on them. So we stopped that. Were reversing decades of the Biden betrayals that decimated Pennsylvania jobs, you know that. This state lost, listen to this, one in three manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and Chinas entrance into the World Trade Organizations, one of the worst things that happened, when China came in. They were flat-lined for many years, then they came into this crazy deal. Theyre considered a developing nation, you see Ive been sort of protesting that like, but theyre considering China as a developing nation, you get all sorts of things that you would never get, advantages over the United States. Well we have very strongly protested that. Theyre not a developing nation, theyre a very powerful developed nation, and you know what They got to pay what everyone else has to pay. Earlier this year I kept my promise to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement into law which is in effect now and really doing well. Everyone said it will never happen, and I had great help from these gentlemen right here. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to Chinas pillaging, plundering and rampant theft of Pennsylvania and many other places, jobs. Thats all throughout the world by the way but our states have been just pillaged by China and others. Joe Bidens agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in America. After years and years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country, its called America First. Were America First, thats enough, and were bringing our soldiers back home. You see whats going on. After 19 years in Afghanistan, far away places, to bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunity zones, Tim Scott, great senator from South Carolina worked on it with me. Passed criminal justice reform, delivered permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities that Obama would never do and before the China virus we achieved the lowest African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American unemployment rates ever recorded by far. And theyre now heading back in that direction quickly. Democrat politicians have failed the black community for decades, theyve failed the Asian community, the Hispanic community. They failed women. The numbers on womens unemployment were the best in 61 years. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the American people. He was always for things that you wouldnt want and now hes changing, No, I never said that. I never said that. Ive spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African-American community and for all communities and the best is yet to come. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds and on the subject of immigration, weve been fighting for that. Under my administration we achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and weve deported 20,000 gang members and we get them out and we get them out fast. Thank you ICE. ICE and Border Patrol. ICE and Border Patrol. They dont like ICE because ICE is, theyre tough. You got to be tough in that job by the way. Anybody up here like to work in ICE I dont think so. Lets see, you could probably be okay but youd rather do what youre doing, right I agree with you. These are tough guys, they have to be tough. These are bad, bad gang members. I mean you look at MS-13, you look at whats happened with MS-13, you look at  We get them the hell out. Sometimes we have to put them in prison because we dont even want to take a chance, they can come back in after what theyve done, we had thieves, we had some very bad people in the VA and theyre all gone. Thank you, I love you too, thank you. Thank you. Such friendly voices. Quite beautiful. Only in Pennsylvania, right Thank you. I withdrew from the last administrations disastrous Iran nuclear deal, think of this. Obama paid 150 billion for a short-term deal. He gave 1.8 billion in cash. You ever see a million dollars like at a casino floor or something in 100 bills Its a lot, its like the size of this, right Now think 1.8 billion. How did you guys allow that to happen They said we all voted against it. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel. You never know nowadays, right And I opened the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Theyve been trying to get that done for 52 years, I got it done immediately. By the way, as far as the capital of Israel, Jerusalem, theyve been talking about many, many presidents. They all promised it, nobody did it. I did it. We get things done, and we just did something that is incredible. Even the New York Times gave it good reviews, not good reviews, beyond good reviews. Tom Friedman gave it phenomenal reviews, you believe that Thats we achieved the first breakthrough in Middle East peace in decades, a deal with Israel and the UAE. Its a deal with Israel and the UAE and thats going to lead and Im going to tell you we have representatives over right now and other people are saying we want to get in that deal. Youll have peace in the Middle East. We want to get the hell out. Lets get them all back. Lets get thel all back. Dont forget, were energy independent. There used to be a reason. Now we do have a reason, its called Israel, and we have some very good partnerships over there. In all fairness we have some countries that have treated us very well and were going to take care of those countries, but we are energy independent for the first time and thats a very good feeling. Our military has never been stronger than it is now. Its new and its beautiful and I told you we took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi, and separately, we killed the worlds number one terrorist, number one terrorist for decades and decades, Qasem Soleimani. We killed Soleimani. Its a big step for the Middle East. We kept America out of wars. Remember they always said, Oh, this Trump. Hes radical, hes really, I mean hes off the  Hes too radical. Hell get us in wars. I kept us out of wars, what happened with North Korea Look, I get along with Kim Jong-un. They say, Thats terrible he gets along. No its good if I get along. If I get along with Russia, is that a good thing or a bad thing I think its a good thing. These guys only fight to tie, they dont fight to win, you fight to win. You look at whats happening where theyre all coming back home. I even reduced in Germany because Germany, theyre an ally, but you know, they took advantage of us very badly on trade and very badly with our military. So we removed a lot of soldiers out of Germany. Theyre not happy, they said, This is going to hurt our economy. Well its good for our economy, okay They thought it was going to hurt the German economy. Well, they dont treat us right, they dont pay their bills, theyre delinquent. You know what delinquent is Theyre delinquent. They dont pay their bills. We protect them, they dont pay their bills. We got to do something and they treat us horribly on trade through the European Union which basically they run. Together weve been rapidly fixing a half a century of disasters and Biden was there for every one of them. Joe Biden supported NAFTA, Chinas entry into the World Trade. He supported the Korean deal, the Korean deal was so bad, it was so bad. This was a deal that was going to produce to South Korea done by Crooked Hillary Clinton, this was a deal that was going to produce 250,000 jobs. She said,  This will be 250,000, and she was right, for South Korea. It produced 250,000 jobs. For us, we got nothing. We got losses, we got nothing. It was a terrible deal, I renegotiated, now its a good deal. They also gave and want to give mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Biden supported cutting Social Security. He voted for the Iraq War, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani, when I did that, he said, Thats a terrible thing. Thats a terrible thing. Everybody in the Middle East, they couldnt believe it. They celebrated, some of them quite quietly I must add. Sign your mail-in ballot. You sign it and send it in and then you have to follow it and if on Election Day or early voting, that is not tabulated and counted, you go vote, and then if for some reason after that, it shouldnt take that long, it comes in, theyre not going to be able to tabulate it because you will have voted. But you have to make sure your vote counts because the only way theyre going to beat us is by doing that kind of stuff. Im trying to be nice. Im trying to be nice. They want to send out congressmen 80 million ballots. Now there have been many races over the last year where theyve done this and theyve been a disaster. You look at New York, they had a congressional race, not a very good congresswoman, very untalented, I know her well, I lived in New York. Shes not got much going. They have no idea what the vote is, I think 20% of the ballots were missing and then they declared her the winner and the other guy said, What about me Hes not too happy, her opponent. You look at what happened in Paterson, New Jersey, you look at what happened in Virginia, you look at what happened  Theres not a race, and these are small, these are easy to control. they want to send out 80 million unsolicited, I like it much better, they used to say universal, they used to say live ballots, I like the word unsolicited, and solicited. Solicited is okay, because thats when youre asking and you want it and you send in the necessary paperwork and documentation and you get the ballot and you fill it out, thats okay. But you cant, this whole thing with the unsolicited, unsolicited means youre sitting there. We have a big enthusiasm edge, but when they throw these things in your face and the lists are inaccurate and people are dead and dogs have gotten ballots, they have. Dogs have gotten ballots and they know Im right and everybody knows Im right and they say Im right behind the closed doors and its a disgrace, what they do to our country. 80 million unsolicited ballots. People that had no idea. People that werent going to vote in all fairness. Its really unfair because our people have enthusiasm, theyre going out to vote. Theyre all going out to vote. Everybody here going to vote Everybody They have no enthusiasm. So I said, So thats unfair. That guy walks and then theyll have somebody knock on the door, say, Listen, I would like your ballot. I dont want to vote. I dont care about Biden. Im a Democrat. I dont care about this guy. Well look, where is it Here take it, blah blah blah. They even have a provision where you dont have to verify signatures. What is going on And they have another provision in some states where you can harvest, thats where you grab them all together and drop them. In Nevada, they actually have a provision where they dont have to be counted until seven days after the election. So that means if we have a close election, could be close, I hope its not, I hope we have a landslide like youve never seen. But if we have a close election that means Nevada has the right to, and I love Nevada, I think were going to win Nevada, except where theyre sending all these hundreds of thousands, millions of unsolicited ballots to people in Nevada and people that probably left a long time ago. Its very unfair, its very unfair, but think of it. They have seven days after the election. Did you know that Mike Seven days, what does that mean I want to see the results of the election on November 3. By the way, if its anything like these other events, it could go on forever. I mean the congressional race which they just gave up and they declared her a winner which they should not have done, they should make that a do-over and I think in Paterson they have a do-over. I think theyre going to do it over because it was just ripe with fraud, theft. People were selling ballots, people were selling ballots, and you know they talk about Russia. Theyre so worried about Russia. What about sending out 80 million ballots Thats your real problem, and if Russia or China or these other countries want to cheat, all they have to do is forge ballots. Its much easier than the way they have to go about it, right So we have to put pressure on these people. Now the good news is we have a lot of court cases we have won in Pennsylvania, you know that, right We have two judges, we have a state judge, we have a federal judge. I think both highly qualified judges from what I understand, I hear that theyre not too happy about what theyre seeing. So well see what happens. Were going to see what happens. The lawyers feel very confident but we have to win those cases but what you have to do is send in your early ballot and then go and make sure that ballot is tabulated or counted, and if its not counted, vote, and then they have the job, if it comes in late, and if its not too late, they have the job of making sure that they dont count it. But follow that ballot because these people, theyll be lost, theyll be gone, the numbers are incredible where theyre 25 and 30% off, 20% off. Follow your ballot. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Sleepy Joe hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. You know that. You know he always gets up today, COVID-19, COVID-19. I say, Joe, look. We got a country, and I agree with that and weve done a hell of a job. Weve done a hell of a job. If you look at some of our numbers. You got to start talking about the economy and you got to start talking, your place, I mean this is  When you look at Pennsylvania, youre in a shutdown. You have a governor that has you shut down we know the susceptible are old people, senior citizens, nursing homes. People that are old, especially if they have heart problems or if they have diabetes. We know that, we learned it, and we opened it up. But the problem these shutdowns are causing much bigger problems. You remember my original statement, right The cure cant be greater. It was an original statement that a lot of people picked up but its so true. You have to open up this commonwealth, it has to be opened up. It has to be opened up now. But theres what I think theyre doing, because you have the same thing in New York. We have a governor in New York who is 36,000 people died, 11,000 people in a nursing home because he made a mistake. He made a horrible mistake, and I built him a convention center with 2,800 beds and they didnt use it and I sent up a ship, a great hospital ship, a massive hospital with hundreds and hundreds of rooms and they didnt use it and he requested it and then I said, Youre not using it. Why arent you using it He could have put those people in the convention center in the hospital ship. What a shame how long can you do this for Restaurant, poor guys. You cant, how long can you do this for The people are going to lose their jobs. Theyre never going to open again. Its not like the restaurants is the greatest business in the world. Its a hard business. New York is closed. Youre closed. North Carolinas closed. Michigans  all Democrats. Let me tell you, whats going to happen on November 4th. Theyre going to announce their opening. Theyre doing this for political reasons. They are. Right, John Theyre doing it for political reasons because they want our numbers to look as bad as possible, going into November 3rd, election day. Then as soon as the elections over with, win, lose or draw for them, theyre going to open it. They got nothing. You know what Its a shame what theyre doing. For political reasons, theyll be open. Youll be open on November 4th, but you know what From your standpoint, its very close to the election. Its very far if you have a restaurant, and you cant open your restaurant. You cant open your store. Its a disgrace and they ought to get together. They ought to do it. These are Democrat governors in all instances and Democrat mayors. When the China virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Thanks to the life- saving therapies that we pioneered, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since April. Think of that. Weve achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country, anywhere in the world. You never hear that from the fake news. They dont want to talk to you about it. This is a big country. This is a tougher country to do that with, the European Unions case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours. If you look now, Spain is having a big blow up. France is having a big blow up. Now, weve done a great job, we havent been given credit for it. He always starts off, COVID-19. Thats all he knows. COVID-19. I said, What about the economy What about jobs What about all the other things we have to do All he does, he thinks its a weak spot, and actually in theory, if were getting a fair shake from those people back there, its actually what the job weve done is actually a strong spot. That includes you people, with the ventilators that nobody had. Nobody that needed a ventilator, didnt get a ventilator. Now were supplying them all over the world. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30% greater increase in excess mortality than the United States. Think of that. You dont hear these numbers. Cases in the US have declined by 28% nationwide over the last month, and hospitalizations and deaths have declined radically over the last week. Three vaccines are in final stage of clinical trials. Would have taken two years for another president. I was going to say a normal president, but theyll hit me with  A little truth to that too. Now, but for another president, especially, in the last administration, they had the H1N1 pandemic. It was called Swine flu. You know, Joe always calls it the N1H1. He gets it mixed up. No, its the H1N1, Joee. Not that it matters, I guess. No. Do you ever notice, hes always calling it the other. He calls it the opposite. He has no clue where he is, but he keeps saying, Oh, if he was, well he didnt want the ban China, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by banning China. I was the only one that wanted to do it, actually. Then we banned Europe because I saw what was happening in Italy and Spain and France. We banned Europe. We saved hundreds of thousands. If I didnt do the closing and the opening, so were at 175,000, far too  look, one is too much because this was given to us by China, and its a disgrace. Its a disgrace. They could have stopped it. They stopped it from going into China, but not going to the rest of the world, including our country. Its a disgrace. But think of it. Joe Biden got the worst marks youve ever seen for his handling of the H1NI Swine flu. They said it was incompetent, and the head guy, who now hes trying to retract. Its a little tough. Thats one great thing about the tape. He said it was horrible. He said, we did a horrible job. He said, they got lucky. Its not contagious like this. We got, this is a tough one. I can look at that guy and hell catch it. Right there, and hes very far away from me. Its a tough one, because its so contagious. I tell you what, our Vice-President, Mike Pence, and the task force, headed up by Mike and working along with a lot of great people, theyve done a fantastic job and they just get no credit. If I was a Democrat, a different president, and they did the same job, theyd say it was one of the greatest jobs theyve ever seen. But take a look at what they say about the way they handled the Swine flu. It was a disaster. It was incompetent. They called themselves incompetent. They call, and now theyre coming in like, well, we would have done this and Biden by the way, was against, you remember, xenophobic, racist, because I closed down China. Then two months later, two and a half, three, and Nancy Pelosi was having dances in Chinatown, right A month later. No, no problem. I was way ahead. Then Biden comes out and he actually said that I was right, but they said, Dont say that, try doing it a little softer than that. He did it a little bit softer, but we were right. They were wrong. They handled it so badly. Just take a look, because we, I said to my people, Weve got to fight this a little bit differently because were getting a lot of fake news, a lot of bad people saying things, and you look at the stats and you look at how weve done compared to really much easier and much smaller countries, its amazing. If you took New York out of it, which was a disaster by Cuomo, if you took New York out of those numbers, we would have numbers that would be even better than they are. I could read numbers that would be even much better, because a big percentage of the people that died in this country died because New York was incompetently run by Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo. By the way, just today, theres another credible thing happening. Pfizer, great company, announced that it expects to have the results of its vaccine trials in a matter of weeks, very shortly. Incredible. Under Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to produce a safe and effective vaccine, in that record time that we talked about. This would have been years later. Itll be delivered before, in my opinion, before the end of the year, but it really might even be delivered before the end of October. How do you like that Wouldnt that be nice That would be nice. You know why Not because of the electric. Itll be nice because we want to save people. Thats why itll be nice. Thats the important thing. Together, we will defeat the virus. The job were doing is, the job that all of the people working on it, our generals, our admirals, the distribution, we bought billions and billions of dollars of things, and now we make gowns and we make masks and we make shields and we make ventilators. Very tough. The ventilators very complicated, very big, very expensive. Its like, I made the statement, its like building a car, but more sophisticated. They said, No, its not. They said, they took a ventilator. They took it apart. These people are the worst, the worst. Over the next four years, well make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. Thats what well do. Let me just tell you something. If they didnt waste a year and a half of my life on a ridiculous impeachment, based on a phone call that was perfect, this stuff would have all been done. Would have all been done, truly. It would have all been done. Yet, with all of this stuff, the fake Russia witch hunt, the fake Ukraine. How about that Did anybody read the transcript of that call It was a perfect call. Hey, congratulations. Good luck. It was like a perfect call. Now theyll take it back and theyll say, Well, I dont know. This was a per  In history, theres never been anything like this. It was a totally lopsided, 100% political witch hunt, and it goes on and on. These are bad people. I really believe they dont love our country. I watched Nancy Pelosi. You must wear your mask. You have to wear your mask, and were going to keep every beauty salon closed in California and all over the country. Then I see a picture. I say, Nancy Pelosi. Well, wheres the mask Ill tell you what. She must have treated that beauty salon owner pretty badly. She uses the salon and the salon turned her in The salon turned her in. I dont think I would have turned her in. I wouldve said, Well, you know, shes a customer. I got to take care of my customers, right But she made them open, and the salon turned her in and the salon did business with her. How much do they hate Nancy Pelosi Then she made a terrible mistake because you want people that cant be set up. She said, I was set up. I was set up by the salon owner. I was set up. I said, Tell me she didnt say that, please. I just put out, that if she was set up, then she shouldnt be leading the House of Representatives. I want the salon owner to lead the House of Representatives, because she set up  Think of it. She set up the Speaker of the House. That was a big mistake. As soon as I heard, she said, Well, shes sent me up, Nancy, youre not supposed to get set up. Youre representing our country. You know what she should have done honestly She should have said, I made a mistake, sorry, and nobody would be talking about, this is like the biggest story. This is the big, crazy Nancy, highly overrated person. Let me just say she is a highly overrated person. They give her such good play. She is a highly overrated person. Look, they just turned off a camera because they dont want me saying that. Just in closing, we will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assault on law enforcement. Surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities and ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens. We will not let them threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars. We will end surprise medical billing. We dont want surprise medical billing. You know what happens Its terrible, but we have ended it. Also, weve signed something thats incredible. Youre going to see. Some people say its bigger than healthcare, and I signed it. Unfortunately it takes place on January 1st. You better elect me. You better elect me. Its called price transparency. I said to my people at the end of the day, what is price transparency This is going to lower your prices by 50%. Youll be able to negotiate. Youll be able to do things youre not even allowed to do now, with hospitals, with doctors. You get better doctors, you get lower prices. I said, When does it start Its a complicated  Oh, did I get, I was fought. You have no idea. Right fellows You have fought too. But they fought me on this price transparency. Its bigger than healthcare, could be bigger than healthcare. But I said, When does it start They said, Sir, we have it all set. When January 1st, I said, Id better win this election, because youre going to see some unbelievable price reductions. That includes on drugs, because were reducing health insurance premiums massively, and the cost of prescription drugs went down the first time in 51 years, last year. But now its going to go down very big, because we did a favorite nations clause. I see the drug companies are, theyre killing me with ads. They have nothing but cash. They have nothing but money. Theyre spending because they cant believe  Germany and other countries pay much less than we do. We want to have, what we have to have, is we have to have a comparison of prices. Thats what it is called, favored nation clause. I instituted a favorite, so were paying 2.50 for a pill, and some nation is paying 25 cents for the same exact pill from the same factory, right We get the 25 cent price. So, whats going to happen thatll go up. Ours will come way down. They cant believe it. The drug companies cant believe, and I will tell you, Mark Meadows is here, our Chief of Staff. Wheres Mark They want to negotiate. They called. We signed it. Its all done. They want to negotiate and they are negotiating, so lets see what happens, but were going to get you cuts on prescription drugs, the likes of which youve never seen. Well protect Medicare and Social Security. They will not be able to protect it. It will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. When I took over, NASA was dead. Now its the most vibrant space center in the world, by far. We will restore patriotic education to our schools and well teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God, We Trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania us. Its where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, and where General George Washington, who, by the way, they want all of the name, Washington removed from everything. I havent been keeping up with it. What did he do George Washington, they want the name off. Congressman are we okay showing  I dont think you liked that idea too much. George Washington. They want his name off everything, but well keep it. I promise you this. As long as you canceled culture, you better have a strong president. Canceled culture. George Washington, can you believe But he led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware. This is the Commonwealth where our union was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg and where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mined the coal, worked the railroads, forged the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of world. Thats in the history of the world and we are making it greater than its ever been before. Thats whats going to happen. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country from these very, very deranged people. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving like never before. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, and together we will work very hard. The people of Pennsylvania, the great, great people of Pennsylvania, where I went to college. Its a place I know very well. But, we will make America wealthy. Again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Pennsylvania."

We just take it. Just take it. Weve won it. I like it that better. You know they say theyre going to have a lot of problems tomorrow. I hate to tell you this. I dont know. Have you heard I hear their computers are all messed up. Just like they were in Iowa. Theyre not going to be able to count their vote. Theyre going to tell you about healthcare. Theyre going to tell you about our military and the jet fighters and the missiles and rockets, but they cant count votes. They just cant count them. They cant count votes, but theyre saying they may not be able to do it again. Theyre still trying to tell us.

Now, we have some special people here, you know the special very special people. And we celebrate one of the greatest moments in the history of sports. Some people say it was the single greatest moment in the history of sports. It was called the miracle on ice. Do you remember that That was when the Russians had a team assembled. That was probably, they say maybe the greatest team ever assembled. They were unbelievable. And our guys played a practice game with them was it a couple of weeks before, and I hate to tell you the score was 10 to 3, and the USA was not on top, and this team was an incredible team and they went in and it was amazing, but tomorrow marks the 40 years since the United States mens hockey team defeated then Soviet Union team in the 1980 Olympics. Incredible. That was incredible. Most of you remember that. Im looking. Weve got a lot of young ones, but weve got a lot of people that remember that. A lot of people. And by the way, we got the Olympics coming back or coming to Los Angeles. Thank you. Thank you President Trump. Thank you President Trump. Thank you very much. Thank you President Trump. Eight years.

But thats okay. 2028 Olympics is coming to Los Angeles. Its going to be great. And we worked with the mayor of Los Angeles. He was great. He called up and we gave him a lot of help. I was president elect then because the president didnt want to get involved. He didnt want to get involved in getting the Olympics, so they called me and I was president elect, hadnt taken office. Then I got involved and Ill tell you, they were happy we got involved. It was great. Its going to be very exciting today. We are thrilled to have with us 14 players of that really incredible gold medal team. Give him a big hand. And they were amazed. They said, boy is a big crowd. I said, its only because you guys are coming. This day was supposed to be for this evening. And I said, let me get back to Washington, do it early. So we gave you almost no notice. You have thousands of people outside, thousands of people inside. You had to see, we were in Iowa we were in New Hampshire. You saw what happened in Colorado last. That was unbelievable. Every place we go its the same. Its been incredible. I dont know if you saw the pictures last night of the outside in Colorado. It was incredible. It was. You could have filled that arena up four times and it was a big arena, and its something. So I hated to do it to you at 12 oclock but I said, lets go. I want to get back. We got to deal with China. We got to deal with Russia. We got to deal with North Korea, South Korea. We got to deal with the rest of the world. Get my people back. We got to get the hell out of here, right But we have a lot of time. Id like now to invite these incredible sport legends to join me on stage. A friend of mine and a very good golfer, by the way, Captain Mike he rode a bike. Mike. Wheres Mike Where is he Mike. Do you know who he is Hes a fake handicap is what he is. Say something Mike. Just welcome everybody to ironic we happen to be here to celebrate our 40th anniversary, the Vegas Knights flew the whole team out to honor us tonight and for the weekend and we obviously thank the people of Las Vegas for having us here and were looking forward to celebrating a special time, and its a great honor for the president to invite us to be part of this event as well. So Vegas, thanks for having us. But just tell them, am I a good athlete and am I a good golfer Thanks Mike. That was some goaltending right How many did you rebuff I mean, but how many did Jim have Many did. Very few. But a lot of shots, right He was like a pinata. So Mike, that was great. Goaltender Jim Craig. So Jim rebuffed come here, Jim. Great goaltender, great goaltender. They didnt know what was happening. They kept shooting. He doesnt know how many you rebuffed. How many did you rebuff 37. So let me ask you, was that as goaltender, because that was incredible. Was that the greatest game you ever played Youve had a lot of great games. But was that the greatest game youve ever played It was slightly important. 37. 37. Bill Baker. Bill, come up. Bill Baker. Dave Christian, Ken Morrow, Jack OCallahan, Mike Ramsey. Those legs took a beating. Mark Wells, Neil Brotton, John Harrington, Rob McClanahan, Buzz Schneider, Dave Silk, Phil Verchota, and a great coach and assistant coach at the time, Craig Patrick. They said four more years, 12 more years left for them. Look at that. Look at the press. Hey Mike, look at the fake news back there. Its a lot. I always say thats like the Academy Awards used to be. This year, we had a movie, they said best movie, they announced the movie from South Korea. I said, whats that all about The movie was made in South Korea. Look, I get along great with South Korea, but you know, I never saw that one before. They used to go best foreign movie, but now we do it that way. I dont get it, but thats what it used to be and this is really an incredible time. Ill tell you what, for our country, thats why I like to see things that we do get honored because nobody is doing what we do. Nobody can do it like us. Were the greatest country in the world again. We have the greatest people. We have the greatest military by far. Weve totally rebuilt our military. Jobs are booming, incomes are surging, poverty is plummeting. Factories are returning confidence is soaring, like these guys, the confidence is soaring, but you know, we do have somebody that Id like to point out because this team is, they had a coach, and that coach was a very inspirational coach, would you say Mike And Id like to have maybe one of you come up and just say a few words about Coach Brooks because he was very, very, he was really a big, he was a big heart on this team. Please. Say something. So tell me one thing, one thing. So I see those tears. That means you think, you miss him and you love him. Right Was he actually a nice guy Because he looked tough. Mike was just saying he was brutal, but he was a good guy, right Tough but great. Thank you very much. Thanks Kelly. Thank you all. Greatest sports story could be number one. So a lot of people, a lot of these sports experts, sports writers have voted that as the single greatest sporting event or athletic achievement. I think so, yeah They put it number one, certainly top five. In the history of our country, we have a lot of things that weve done to break records. Were going to go over them, but weve broken a lot of records now, but I want to thank that great team for being with us. Very inspirational. This is a big day. The anniversary. Thank you fellas. Thank you. In my state of the union address, I proudly declare that we are in the midst of the great American comeback and were just getting started. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and partisan Democrat crusades. By the way, I think theyre starting another one. Did you see that I see these phoneys. These are the do nothing Democrats. They said today that Putin wants to be sure that Trump gets elected. Here we go again. Here we go again. Did you see it A story. Arent people bored Now, does that include because a couple of weeks ago, crooked Hillary said Chelsea Gabbard, right. Tulsi Gabbard and right She was a Russian agent. Tulsi and also Stein from Jill Stein. I dont know Jill Stein. I never met the woman. She is a Green Party candidate or was they said shes an agent of Russia. I dont know her and I dont know Tulsi. The only thing I know about both of them is theyre not agent. They are not agents of Russia. These people are sick. Thats pencil neck, pencil neck again. Little pencil. No, I just see it again. I was told that was happening. I was told a week ago. They said theyre trying to start a rumor. Its disinformation. Thats the only thing theyre good at. Theyre not good at anything else. They get nothing done. Do nothing Democrats. That Putin wants to make sure get elected. Listen to this. So doesnt he want to see who the Democrats going to be Wouldnt you rather have, lets say Bernie Wouldnt he rather that Bernie who honeymooned in Moscow Wouldnt that be These people are crazy. Thats all they think about. They dont think about the country. They dont think about jobs. They dont think about lowering your drug costs. Infrastructure. These people are crazy. Trust me, I like what were doing and I love this country. I love this country. Now, and I campaigned on it, at the same time we want to get along with Russia, we want to get along with China, we want to get along with all these countries. Who the hell needs to have conflict But these people are sick, they are sick people. The radical lefts attempts to poison our democracy and overturn the last election have totally ended in a big fat failure. And by the way, you saw today, single best day Ive ever had is the polls and any poll that the fake news gives you, because the real numbers are higher, but any poll they give you as a fake. But Wisconsin, the great state of Wisconsin, I was leading by many, many, many points against every one of these characters. Can you believe it We got a new one. Mini Mike. How did he do in the debate the other day Mini Mike. Heres a box Mike. Here Mike. Mini Mike. He was a beauty. What happened huh He couldnt breathe. What happened Mike would like to know how about that Pocahontas screaming at him. She forgot. She forgot that she lied about her own heritage. She said she was an Indian because she had high cheekbones. That was the only thing. Remember what I said, I have more Indian blood in me than she has and I have none. Right I have none. To the best of my knowledge, wouldnt mind having some, but I happen to have none. And she choked and she went out and got a report done. One, 1 thousandth and 24 you know what that means That means probably I do have more. Now why did he bring that up when she was screaming at him Why Because he was gasping for breath. I cant breathe. I cant breathe. Shes hitting me too hard. Pocahontas. Well, she won that debate cause Mike could not respond. Thats what they all said. They all said that. Thats funny. I won, theyre all shouting. Its not me thats saying it. Fake news. You fake news people. No, they all said it though. Who won the debate Trump. You know what The way I look at it, when fake news CNN oops, there goes the camera off. Red light just went off. See, I can tell every one of them. I know them by heart. I know the operators. I know the camera men. Theyre okay. Theyre all on our side by the way. Theyre screamed at. Get that camera off. I dont want to do that. Get that camera off, or its going to be you job. All right, Im sorry. Precedent. But how bout MSDNC Theyre worse than CNN. And theyre owned by people that really are bad. I think theyre very bad for our country. The owners of Comcast, rotten company, bad for our country, very bad. They try, they have all these PR things to try and keep their image nice and clean. What they do on television is so disgusting. I think in the old days you had to have licenses for this stuff, right They can say whatever they want to say. Lets see what happens over the next period of time. Bunch of dishonest people. Comcast, terrible company. Terrible people running that company. And you know what, I had Celebrity Apprentice, I had the Apprentice on for 14 seasons, 14 seasons, and they used to come to my office and they would kiss my ass. Please sign. Please. Please sign. Its an interesting story. They came and we signed, you know who signed me, Jeff Zucker. Its one of the only things hes done good in broadcasting, but I signed and NBC, as you know, is owned by Comcast, but I signed and they figured the show would be a total failure. So they only signed me for one season. You know I was going to have it. It was go on and then the show goes, started at ten went to eight, went to seven, went to five, went to four, went to two. It went to one. I had the number one show in all of television. Number one. It was a phenomenal and the final episode, remember that With the, you remember that Do you remember the final We had, I dont know, it was one of the biggest shows of the year. It was a tremendous success there. But here I was, I signed with NBC and they didnt even want to waste the ink on an option. Usually they have an option for not, you know, just like they didnt do it. You stupid people. So they paid me very little for the first season I think 25,000 a show, which is considered not good. Thats okay. It was fun. I didnt know it was going to be success, you know Hey, just like this was successful. Its a recent. Because when I left and Arnold Schwarzenegger and I like Arnold said some very nice things, so Im not, but the show did not exactly succeed when I left, but I had it on and they wanted me to sign for more and I said, no, Im going to run for president but Ill never forget. I looked at, I didnt know anything about this business and I had an agent, wonderful guy from William Morris, and he said, sir, I dont want you to sign. No business show has ever done well on network television. Well, its not business, its entertainment, celebrity. Sir, I dont want you to sign. Sir, dont sign. I said, yeah, okay. But I have a problem. I shook the hand of somebody I have to. And Mark Burnett was great. He was my guy and but we shook hands. So I have to, but I agreed, you know, I didnt know that no business or no business type show had ever succeeded on a network television. So he said, I dont want you to sign sir, break it. I said, I cant break it. Cant break it. Anyway, so the show I said started at ten, went to nine, went to became, it was the number one show all of a sudden, and the agent called me up and he said, sir, I remember it was six in the morning. I was in bed. He said, sir, the show just went to number one. Id love to see you because I think Im entitled to more money. I said, you didnt want me to do the show. Well, not really. I mean, I was okay. He said, Id really like more money. I said, Jim, I like you very much, Jim, youre fired. Get out. Anyway, I had 14 great seasons over about 11 years because it was so successful, they kept They would have run it. Remember when they did the three hours, the whole night was the Apprentice. I said, wait a minute. Gone With the Wind, to mention the movie a second time, Gone With the Wind is shorter. They had the Apprentice on for three hours. I said even I think its too long. You cant put it up for three. You got leave a little bit like I want to come back next week. But they had it on for three weeks. We did fantastically with it. Comcast did great. NBC did great. They wanted me to sign for another three years. I said, no, Im going to for president. And that was actually the time when I knew I was going to run. Because you know how they were paying a lot of money and whether youre rich or not, its still a lot of money. I dont care how rich you are. Its a lot. Millions and millions of dollars. And I said no, Im going to run for president. And I did that. But from the day I ran, they went from being, you know one But from the day I ran, they went from being wonderful, they were nice. They were nice. I guess if I didnt do well with the show they wouldnt have been nice because they werent nice to other people that failed. People that didnt have good ratings, that business is a very simple business. If you have good ratings, you can treat them like garbage. If you have bad ratings, you can say, Sir, I really respect you so much. Get out of here. Get him out of my yard. Theyre very ruthless people. But Comcast is a rotten company. They forgot totally. And they are worse than CNN. I will tell you that right now. Comcast is worse than CNN. We should call it Comcast, because thats their beautiful maiden name, Comcast. Theyre worse than CNN. Ill, tell you something about CNN. Jake Tapper, today he put out Now I know you dont like him. I know. Who likes him Who the hell can like him I think his wife likes him. Actually. I really believe she does. But let me just tell you, he put out a couple of social media posts today, because I never call it tweet, I call it social media because its much bigger than tweet. What we have, Dan Scavino. The great Dan Scavino. We have won five sites. Were number one on Twitter, were number one on Facebook, and the whole world. The whole world. So its powerful. But Jake Tapper put out some things, basically saying, I believe it, thats the way I read it, that the new Russian thing that started yesterday, that Putin wants to be sure that Trump, which give me a break. Give me a break. But Jake Tapper said it aint so, and if he did say that because they were a little complex, they can turn them around, or when Zucker sees him and said, Why did you put that I want that deleted and I want you to do a different one. But he did say that. So I respect that because its another hoax story. But were standing up for the defense of our constitution, for our freedom, and democracy itself. You know that. I got to get that. Hey, Bobby Bobby See that guy I love that shirt. Bobby, I dont know. He looks like a nice guy. Can you please walk him up, even if you have about five. Come here, come here. Come here. Come here. You got to see this shirt. You got to see this shirt. I love it. Ive got to order me one that I can ride around. Come on. Come on up here. He looks safe. He doesnt look like hes going to start a fist fight. Hes a good fan, I guess. You got to see this shirt. I love it. Is there any place thats more fun than a Trump rally Right How many rallies have you been to 80 80 80. He said 80 rallies. Come up here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Look at these two guys. These guys are serious. These are serious fans, right Are you with him Are you with him Are you with him Youre with him Come on. Come up here. Man. And look at this guy Come on. Thank you, fellas. Wow. I just said, How long have you two been together I figured theyd say, Were married. He met her at the rally in Colorado. Can you believe this Can you believe it Man, did he get lucky. They both got lucky, right They both got lucky. Well, thats cool. No, I just see theres so much stuff out here. Its genius, actually. While the extreme left has been wasting Americas time with viral hoaxes, weve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border, lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. As you heard, we added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. Way above anticipated schedule. And that makes 7 million new jobs since the election. The number was supposed to be under 2 million and we added 7 million. And remember, if I give you wrong numbers, the fake news is going to have headlines. Trump gave you wrong I mean, its very tough. Ive got to be very careful. Even if I give you wrong in the wrong way, theyll say it was wrong. I said, Yeah, but it was wrong in the low way. No, thats no good either. Got to be very precise with these characters. The Democrats dont have to be, but we have to be. Weve destroyed he ISIS territorial caliphate 100%, we killed the founder and leader of ISIS. Al Baghdadi is dead. Al Baghdadi is dead. 17 years. They looked for him. 17 years. Al-Baghdadi. One of the first things I did when I came in. Hes the founder of ISIS and when I came in three years ago, ISIS was all over the place. And I said, You got to knock it out. We knocked it out of Syria, and, Iraq and other places. We really knocked at 100%. Remember I wanted to leave. I said, All right. We were at 96%, then 98, then 99%. I said, Let some of these other countries do it. Wouldnt you say, right So what happened is I wanted to leave and they said, No, no, no, we want 100%. So we wait and stayed. We got 100%, then we moved them all out of Syria, except we did keep the oil. You noticed that, right We kept the oil. Sorry. They said, He left soldiers in Syria. Yeah, I did to keep the oil, if you dont mind. Which is what we should have done in Iraq too, by the way. I would have done that. Im making a lot of money with all that oil. But you remember that whole thing, that whole I said, You got to find Al Baghdadi. Ive been saying that actually for two years. I had a lot of other things to do the first year, like fight off the Democrats. These crazy Democrats with their hoaxes. Think of it. If they use their genius, because they are genius at that stuff, right Theyre really good. They can take nothing. They can take a perfect phone call made to the Ukrainian president who said very specifically there was no pressure. He doesnt even know whats going on and they can take this perfect call. Thank goodness I had a transcriber. Do you agree with it Because the fake whistleblower said that the call was totally different than what the call was. So when I released the call, when I released the transcripts, they died. They said, Oh we got a problem. They never thought I was going to do it, but I had no choice. I had to because I had to show theyre liars. But think of it, they can take something like that, a perfect phone call, or theyll take just out of thin air they can make something up. And they ended up today, front page, New York Times. They used to call it the eighth column. Thats the big column on the right. I dont know. The papers become so small. I dont know if they have an eighth column anymore. They used to have the eighth column, was a big deal, right That was the big deal. Today its too narrow. Think theyre probably After Im gone, they wont have any columns. Thats why eventually theyre going to support me. Eventually, the Times and the Washington post, which will be dead as a doornail after I leave, and the CNN, itll be an obsolete business, the cable business. MSDNC will be out of business. You know, cable was supposed to be obsolete and now theyre doing the highest numbers theyve ever done. If an airplane goes down with 700 people, they dont cover it. If its not Trump related, they dont cover it. Its got to be Trump or Trump related. So if a plane goes down and its total devastation, if the ship goes down, if the Titanic- If the Titanic equivalent went down, they wouldnt cover it unless I was on the sucker. Its true. They wouldnt cover it. The fake news would not cover the equivalent of the Titanic. But you know what theyre going to do before the election Theyre going to say, We want to just say something. Were going to endorse the president. You know why Because theyll be out of business. Can you imagine if they had to cover mini Mike Who I dont think, I think hes gone, but you know what Hell spend another 500 million. Dont forget I spent 70 and I won, of my money. In other words, they said, and this was in the New York Times, I said the other night in Colorado. I spent 70, mini Mike so far has spent almost 500 million dollars in order to get embarrassed by Pocahontas. Pocahontas. And shes mean, isnt she Did you see that Do you see the anger on her face That nervous energy. Shes jumping up and down. Shes a mess. But no, no, shes mean. Right Right That face is just You want to get him She said, I got him. I want to see those agreements. I, You open up those agreements. This poor guy probably signed a hundred of them and each ones a disaster. He said, I dont want to open those agreements. Nobody told me this was going to happen. Said, Actually, sir. Nobody told me. Get me out of here. After the debate, he went backstage, fired a lot of people. He said, How the hell did you get me into this thing But Pocahontas was really mean, but shes going to be easy. I hope its her. Its not going to be her. Cant be, I dont think. Alfred E. Neuman, ladies and gentlemen, introducing president Alfred E. Neuman. Nobody knows because youre all too young. Nobody knows who Alfred its Mad Magazine. They all said No. Howdy Doody. See nobody knows who Alfred E. Neuman is. Only the real aficionados. Theyre the ones and they love it. But thats only 15% of the crowd, right Am I right Better than Howdy Doody. Howdy Doody. And thats what happens when you cant get the words out. No it does. Thats what happens, right When you cant get the words out, you get angry. You get angry because you cant get the words. That might happen to me someday. Can you imagine if that happened to me Man, would I be a bad guy. Id be the meanest man in history. No, but Biden is very angry. He gets angrier, and angrier, and angrier. Hes changed. And then you have the Tom. Yeah. He said Tom Steyer. Tom said,  Mister impeachment. How did that work out, Tom Thank you very much for the great poll numbers between him and nervous dancing. How did that work out This schmuck spends 250 million dollars, he ends up with one third of a percent in Iowa. But maybe that could be Rick, because they still dont have any idea what he got. Maybe he won Iowa, they took it away from him. No, but he was substantially below it. All I know, it said 1% and an arrow left. So he spends 250 million, Tom Steyer. Never heard of this guy. Who is he Where did he get his money Who is he He was in the coal business, did you know that This guy, this phony is a big environmentalist. He made his money, a lot of it, in the coal business. Nobody knows that, but hes a fake. Remember when he walked up to Bernie the other day. Hi Bernie. Hi. Oh, and he was having a fight with Pocahontas, right Is this the greatest Mark Burnett said, This is the greatest reality show in history. He said, You can take The Apprentice, and you can take Survivor, and you can take every other reality show ever made, multiply it times 10,000, and you still dont have what we have. And even the CAS. He did say this. You got the perfect president. You got the perfect first lady. How about the first lady You got the perfect kids. The kids, though. Those beautiful kids. My beautiful kids. They had such a great life, before I did this. Sorry, kids. Sorry. My beautiful Ivanka. She had such a great life. She Had a company that was selling shoes and everything you could sell. Shed just put her name on it and she said, Daddy, does it matter I want to come to Washington and help people get jobs. Right Aint that true And she left the company. And when you leave a company, all of a sudden it doesnt do as well. I wouldnt say that I exactly helped talking about the wall and other things, but she left the company, came to Washington and she said 500,000 jobs. That was her goal. And she did that in the first month. She actually did. Shes gotten these great companies like Walmart, and many others, Exxon, shes gotten them to take millions of people. Shes now over 15 million jobs where they train people and bring them into the companies. Its incredible. 15 million. And shes smart. She got it figured out, but most people cant, but she does. But all they do is give them heat. They work so hard. And could you imagine you take Bidens son. Can you imagine But you know what We dont do any of that stuff. We dont do that stuff. We dont do it. The kid got 3 million dollars, 83,000 a month and he didnt have a job until his father became vice president. And speaking of vice presidents and speaking also of reality television, because its the greatest show of all time, right Look at us. Look. We told you, what, last night Little change here, folks. Were going to move it up from eight oclock in the evening until 12 oclock in the afternoon. Little change. Just a minor change. Because I have to get back to Washington to work. I feel guilty. This is too much fun. But speaking to vice presidents and speaking of perfect vice presidents, if you become president, the first thing you have to do is choose a really horrible, horrible vice president. So if the idiots ever want to impeach you, they have to say, I cant impeach him. Look who we have. I have the perfect vice president. I have the greatest in the world. I have the greatest vice president. I dont know. I got the great ones. I said, I cant do that. I picked a great guy. Hes done a fantastic job. Hes been a great vice president. But it is true. I could have picked, Ill give you names, but dont want to do that because I dont want to hurt anyones feelings. But there are plenty of them out there. Theyre mostly out there and I dont want to do that. But Mike Pence has been great. But tell me, is it perfect casting the whole thing And this isnt about casting, this is about real life. But when Mark Burnett said to me the other day, he said, The greatest reality show of all times, times of million. Thats exactly except for one thing, we work our asses off and we are doing things like nobody has ever done before. Right Right So, we took out Al Baghdadi and then we just took out two weeks ago the worlds top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani of Iran, ending his evil reign of terror forever. Hes the father of the roadside bomb. When you see our beautiful people walking around with no legs, theyre walking, and trying to walk so hard, and theyre really in rough shape hes the father of the he loved the roadside bomb. He thought it was a great thing. Where is he now Soleimani. And Ill tell you what, you know whos happy about it The people of Iran are happy and even the leaders of Iran, because the leaders of Iran were afraid of him. Okay And the fact is, America is respected again. Were winning. Were winning all over. Were winning in Washington that Democrats keep losing their minds. That is why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement. Look, were a unified party. The Republican party has never been unified like it is today. Ill show you. I could say, Were going to go over to the Hill. No, were going to go over to someplace and were going to do a rally at eight oclock tonight. Wed have tens of thousands of people there. Theres never been this. Ronald Reagan was great. I thought he was a great guy, great president, didnt like his policy on trade. Thats okay. Trade. But if he came to Las Vegas, you know theyd have a ballroom, and theyd have 500, maybe a thousand people. What were doing And this isnt even, I must say this, I dont want to tell you this, this is not election season. Because were nine months away. Election season is when youre two months away. Were not even in election season and we have more enthusiasm now. Believe it or not, then we had even before the election in 2016. Its true. Its too early. Its too early. Its true. We have a great gentleman and a woman with us, a friend of mine, mister and misses Sheldon Adelson, right over here. Great, great person. Two great people. Hes got so much money, he doesnt know what the hell to do with it. He owns the Sands Hotel. Thats like one of the smaller businesses. Sheldon, thats like your small business, right He is a great guy. Shes an incredible, shes a doctor, and she studies addiction, and drugs, drug addiction, all sorts of addictions. And she knows more about that subject, I think, than anybody, and she works hard and she doesnt need it. He does not need the money that she brings in. Okay He also happens on the paper. He owns the paper. You own the paper in town, right They wanted like a couple of hundred million dollars too much. You said, Give it to them. Its peanuts. What the hell difference does it make We want to thank the Adelsons. Theyve been incredible fans and they love Israel. They love Israel. I just saw him sitting there. I didnt know they were here. I just see him sitting there. Hes something. The chairman of the Nevada Republican party, whos really been great. Hes been with me for a long time and hes a very committed man. Make America great again. Oh, oh, oh. Lets do a poll quick. Just quick. Ill never get rid of MAGA because Im superstitious. But we just hit an all time high with the stock market. Our military is rebuilt. You just got the greatest tax cuts in history, the greatest rate, regulation cuts, and all this stuff. So, let me ask you this. So, Make America great again, it sort of doesnt work quite as well. So now we have keep America great and we have the new hat. Its higher, stiff. Its like a billboard, right I call it the billboard. Its a billboard. So lets go just that. Because I am very surprised by it. Were going to keep them both, but I just curious if we did go to one, Make America great again  Keep America great I cant. I would have said thats impossible. Make America great again, is the greatest phrase. A lot of people, again, fake news, I think will agree to it. Its the greatest phrase ever used in politics. Its the greatest phrase. Now, who has the greatest phrase ever used in the history of politics and say, Oh, lets go with a new phrase. Right But were going to keep it. So we have to keep MAGA. But now we have CAG, now we have CAG. So we have a both. I just dont have the courage to get rid of the one. It would be too disrespectful. Too disrespectful. But Michael McDonald, I want to thank you and the members of the Nevada Republican central committee. Youre all here. Theyre great people. And the man came here. He loves us. Hes been with us. Rick Harrison of the world famous gold and silver pawn shop. Rick Harrison. You better win, Michael. Otherwise, thats the last time Im introducing you like that. I hear were up. I hear were doing nicely. I hear were doing great. And by the way, the union, I have a lot of respect for that union. Last time, I had a strike in my building during the election. Its the only reason we would have won this state. Brilliantly to save three cents. I could have settled the strike before the election. I wanted to save 2 total. And he wasnt too good. He didnt do too good. But we almost won this state despite I had a big strike. Had thousands and thousands of union guys. They had it, look, they wanted, wanted to show us. But I think that the unions are really with us and the unions have been with us. Theyre Teamsters, so many of the unions. Because Im for the working man and woman, whether youre union or non-union. Some States are all union, some states are no union. But we get them all. And I think were going to have tremendous success. And a lot of the Democrats are going to ruin the healthcare programs that these unions have. The unions have worked hard on healthcare and theyre going to ruin them. Theyre going to take away Well, were going to you can lose 180 million people off of great private healthcare. So well see what happens. But a lot of the Democrats want to do that. They think its wonderful. But together were building the worlds most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society. Thats true. Since my election, over 125- Thats true. Since my election, over 125,000 new jobs have been created right here in Nevada, including over 40,000 new Nevada manufacturing and construction jobs. A 30% increase. The national unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century, and soon were going to have that be a historic number like so many of the others. The average unemployment rate for my administration, this is the coolest of them all, is the lowest for any United States president in recorded history. Thats pretty good. When Im in a debate, theyre saying, were going to do this. I say, listen, we have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country. African American unemployment, Hispanic American. Hispanic, we got a lot of Hispanic. I love Hispanic. Who in this audience is Hispanic Yeah, were doing great. Well, we should be doing great. You have the lowest unemployment rates ever recorded. Asian Americans, likewise the lowest ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest rate in 71 years. African American youth unemployment has reached an all time historic low. People I love, people I mightve helped more than anybody because of choice and accountability. The veterans unemployment rate drop to the lowest record. Lowest in history. The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all time historic low and you got to remember theyre back there checking every word. Theyre going, oh, my god. Hes right. I cant say it because I got all these maniacs back there. Theyre trying to find He put the comma in the wrong place. He didnt make that word plural, therefore he lied. Now Ive got to be very accurate because all these numbers, they check them out. Theyre in there, checking them out. Check on the African American unemployment, please. Please tell me its not historic. These people are among the most dishonest human beings on earth. Not all of them. Workers without a high school diploma. We have millions of people that didnt go through high school. They left. They had problems, good problems, bad problems, families where they dont have the money. They didnt get a high school diploma. Theyve achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded in the history of the United States. Those are important groups of people. Half a million more Hispanic Americans now own a home. Now, Hispanic have done so good. And by the way, you know who understands the border, because we are building that wall like crazy. Remember, they also said, if you build the wall youll lose the Hispanic vote. I said, I got to do whats right. You know who understands the border better than anybody You know who understands crime at the border better than anybody The Hispanics understand it and they dont want to be working and have people come and take their job. Have people come in where they cant pay for their house, have people come in who are very bad people. You have some very bad people. You have murderers and rapists, and we have set all sorts of records at the border, but were up to 122 miles of wall, and it is true. The people that understand it the best are Hispanic. So, thank you. We got to make our country safe. Weve lifted 10 million people off of welfare. Median household income is now the highest ever recorded in our country. Think of that. I say it all the time. President Bush, eight years, 450. President Barack Hussein Obama, eight years,  975. President Donald John Trump, three years. Its actually less when they did the numbers. Three years, including the big tax cuts that we got you and the regulation cuts. Three years. So, you had 450, 975, thats eight and eight. Now were down to three years, a little less, three years,  10,000 per family a year. 10,000 a year. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring American liberty and ending the tyranny of federal bureaucrats. I deal with them. Theyre not good. Its called the swamp. Weve ended the war on American energy, lowering utility bills, reducing prices at the pump, reducing your prices. Part of that number is all of the money that we save at the pump and on electric. I also recently took action on an issue Nevada has been dealing with for over 30 years. Yucca mountain. You know Yucca mountain My budget stops funding for the licensing of waste storage at Yucca mountain, so that we can focus on positive solutions and for much better reasons and alternatives. Why should you have nuclear waste in your backyard I wont say which countries, but you know what other countries do I will not say which ones. They put it on a ship. They float it out into the middle of the ocean. They find a nice deep spot and they dump it. Thats the end of it. But we would never do that for environmental reasons. We are reversing decades so Yucca mountain Youre okay, please. Okay. Just relax. Sheldon, do you have somebody at your newspaper back there who can write. Yucca mountain, please. Hell call up, Yucca mountain is okay. Thats the end of that. So Yucca mountain, youre in great shape. Maybe they can finally report it properly, but were reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. For years, Washington politicians took money from lobbyists, global corporations and corrupt special interest to ship our jobs and factories and all of this stuff and all of this wealth. They stole our wealth. They shipped it overseas and to other countries. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and Chinas entrance into the WTO, the world trade organization. Probably an even worse deal for us than NAFTA, if thats possible, but under my administration, the great betrayal of America is over. America is no longer for sale. Last month we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S., Mexico, Canada agreement USMCA. See, we played the song YMCA because thats the only way youll remember. Just think of the song YMCA. Think of the song and youll remember that USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Nevada. I also took the strongest ever action to confront Chinas massive theft of America jobs. Our strategy worked. Last month, we signed a ground breaking trade agreement. Probably the biggest agreement of any kind ever signed with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property and boost American exports by a lot. China will be buying 250 billion worth of goods from us now and 50 billion from our farmers. My guys wanted 16, I said, make it 50. My guys wanted 16, they got China up to 20. I said, Nope. Got to make it 50, and then I said to China, you got a billion and a half people. What difference does it make They said, youre right. 50 billion, I dont think our farmers can produce that much, but were going to soon find out. Theyre going to buy very large tractors. After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. we are finally putting America first. Or no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than the issue of immigration. Before I came into office, the far lefts policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country, poisoning our children, including right here in a very big way. The great state of Nevada. Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. You know that, youve been complaining about it for a long time. Its one of the reasons you voted for Trump. They want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border and then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare, of healthcare, of lots of other things, including education. All paid for by the taxpayers of the United States. Illegal immigration costs Nevada taxpayers, think of it, more than 1.6 billion every year, over 1,500 per household. For the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild every city, all of these distressed areas in the United States, throughout our country. The money spend, its not even thinkable and dont forget when we say come, like in California the clown, he says, come, well give you free healthcare. People that werent even thinking about coming. Thats why we have caravans of people that were turning back. Mexicos been great. By the way, they gave us 27,000 soldiers on our border. But when a governor, nice guy actually, hes a nice guy. We just got to explain the facts of life. Hes a nice guy. Oh doctor, please. Doctor in the house, please. Medical, please. A doctor. Thank you. Take your time. Weve got plenty of time. Yeah, take your time please. A lot of these people have been here for three days. Its a lot. Those front row people are tough. Take your time, doc. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, doctor. Thats true. They get here so They stand and sit and sometimes days early. In Colorado, theyre there three, four days early. Its tough. And we work it and make sure that you have everything you want. Number one, we cover the facts and number two, we want to have a good time because we have to have a good time. But things like that happen a lot because after two, three days, its not easy and these are strong people. Im not going to fight any of them, okay Now, amazing people. Thank you very much. Under my administration, were finally taking care of our own citizens first, including millions of illegal immigrants who follow our laws, pay their taxes, lift up our society, and are entitled to a government that protects their families and protects their communities. Every day, Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent people. You know whats happening, you know whats going on. In this region alone last year, ICE officers, and theyre patriots. Theyre strong, tough patriots. If we didnt have them. They remove thousands and thousands of MS13 gang members a year and plenty of others. Who else is going to do it ICE officers arrested over 5, 000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses, including robbery, rape, and even murder. Many murders. In Western Nevada, an illegal alien was charged with robbing and brutally executing four victims last year. Right here in Las Vegas, three MS13 gang members abducted a man, tied him up with his shoelaces, shot him repeatedly, and hacked him to death with a machete. You know exactly what Im talking about. Its right here in your place, in Las Vegas, right here. Tied up and hacked him to death. Yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens, even convicted criminals and murderers, and they support deadly sanctuary cities. I say this all the time and I just How the hell, where are they coming from I dont get it right. Seriously, I dont get it. Sanctuary cities imperil American lives by releasing dangerous criminal aliens directly into your communities. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote Republican in 2020. And you have some great ones here, Michael. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row. And as the wall gets longer, it gets easier and easier. Remember when the Democrats were saying, you dont need a wall. Two things that never change, right All these computers, they said, use drones. Oh great, well fly over with drones. Watch the people pour in by the thousands. Thats great. Use drones. Before I came along, they all wanted a wall. They just didnt know how to build it. They had no clue. They had the money, they actually gave the money back, but they had no clue. But as soon as I came in and I said, Wall, they went against and I made a terrible mistake. We catch them. You know the story. They come over, could be a killer, murderer, rapist. They come over. We cant do anything. We have to be politically correct. We catch them. We then say, whats your address They dont know. They dont even know their country in many cases. Where do you come from We dont know and they mean it, but some are very serious criminals. So, we catch them, we take whatever they can take, which is nothing, and then we had to release them in our country. We cant bring them back. And then we have a system of judges, thousands of judges all over the place. You got to be like Perry Mason and every illegal that comes in, they have the lawyers. The lawyers meet them, they get paid fees, but were breaking the system. No more catch and release, you think that was easy And the big thing is that 30 foot And this wall is built exactly to the specifications of border patrol. Totally. And border patrol has seized the largest amount, just recently, of deadly narcotics ever recorded. The largest amount. Weve deported record numbers of gang members. Weve done more to secure the border than any administration in history. We are, as I said, building the wall faster than ever. Faster and bigger than anyone thought possible. They cant believe were getting it done. Well have over 500 miles of wall built sometime next year. 500 miles. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now. 132 congressional Democrats have now signed up for Bernie Sanders takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million Americans, many of them in this room, of their private coverage. Remember president Obama Remember, he said, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. 28 times, he lied, so we should impeach him. Were going to impeach him. Well do a belated impeachment. 28 times, you can keep your doctor, right Remember, you could keep your doctor. Unfortunately, when they found out you cant keep your doctor, he said, I was just kidding. Now, we should impeach him. Well do a belated impeachment. Fake news, you have it. See, you have to be very careful when you say impeachment because you know what they do They go back and they write. President Trump said that Obama should be impeached, but hes not in office and so therefore they cant impeach. He doesnt know what hes talking about because hes not in office, so therefore they cant. So, you have to be very careful. Thats why I use the word belated impeachment. Belated, meaning Im just kidding, okay They do it all the time. They had it the other day. I said, bring back Gone With The Wind, right I said a little bit up here, but I said the movie the other day in Colorado, I guess. I said, Huh, South Korean movie won. They said, ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the Academy Award is  A movie made in South Korea, whats this all about And I deal with them, they like me. Were helping them a lot. Theyre killing us on trade. They beat us on trade and then they win the Academy Award for a fricking movie. But we redid that trade deal, but the other day they got me on this one too. I said, whatever happened to Gone With the Wind, that beautiful movie Vivian Lee, Clark Gable, right Whatever happened, bring back Gone With the Wind. And some of them wrote, he doesnt know that that movie was made in 1936. He says fake news. It is fake news, theyre fakers. But now, anybody sitting there reading this saying, man, Trump, cant be that smart. He said bring back Gone With the Wind. Thats an old movie. Yeah, its an old classic. What I say is make great movies, not this computerized garbage. And I was never a fan of Brad Pitt, I will tell you that. No, I thought he was a stiff. He was a stiff, its like a boring guy. All of a sudden he wins the Academy Award, so fitting. Their ratings arent so good at the Academy Awards. You know when that stopped When they started attacking us, their ratings went right down the tubers. I told somebody, the evening newscasts, theyre terrible for conservative people and theyre crooked, theyre absolutely dishonest. I said to one of the big broadcasters, Im friendly with him. I said, if you ever did a conservative newscasts, instead of you got, ABC is terrible. NBC is just absolutely atrocious. And they do badly. Not a lot of people are watching. They used to, when we had the late, great Walter Cronkite and these legends, right But ABC is terrible and NBC is terrible and CBS is terrible. Theyre all the same. And I said, your ratings stink. If you would do a newscast thats conservative, Id get them a host. I could recommend guys right now, right Id get them a host. Well call up Dont take Sean Hannity away from us. Dont take our show. Thats my problem, I dont want to take away any of our people. You get a Pete Hegseth. You get a Jesse Waters. You get I could name so many of them, right And you put them on that broadcast, their ratings would go up five fold but they dont know that. I dont know. Theyre stupid. Their ratings would go through the roof, but they would rather have a failed broadcast that nobody watches than put on a conservative person and lift the ratings five times. They would rather have a fail Seven months ago we had a little skit, and they were hoping the market would crash because they would rather lose their money, or big parts of it, and have a really horrible market on the basis that we, not me, we could not be elected on November 3rd. This is how crazy-  on November 3rd. This is how evil, this is how crazy they are. Theyve gone crazy. I guess you call it Trump derangement syndrome. But if they ever did a conservative broadcast, meaning very fair, very honest When I say that, its almost like do a fair broadcast. Just a fair broadcast. That thing would be the hottest show. But they dont realize it. And if they do, they probably wouldnt do it anyway because they dont want to go away from what theyre doing, which is crazy because it is, theyre doing very poorly. While the social and socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare and your Social Security, theyre putting it at risk, my administration is protecting your Social Security. Remember they said, four years ago in the debates and you had this crazy woman. I mean, I hate to mention her name. I did it you know, yesterday. I threw all the runs, hates it. Shes a zero. Its got zero television personality. Aero AB Stoddard, whoever that is. She said, Donald Trump lost all of his debates. I won every debate and maybe, I dont know maybe one somebody, but I won with tremendous numbers. He says, You always won. Im not sure. We try, Ill tell you that and were winning now. But this crazy woman whos got zero going, zero. She said, Donald Trump lost his debates that he won. You know, she was talking about how badly Benny Mike did. So she said, Well, Donald Trump. No, I won every single debate. I won them against crooked Hillary. I won them in the primaries like 15 or 16 debates. And for some reason, you know, sometimes you do say, its not a big deal. Nobody watches it. Nobody cares. Nobody even knows who she is. I just made her famous, right Shes nothing. Shes nothing. Shes got no talent, got nothing. Shes probably got a little drive. Thats how she keeps getting on television. Other people dont have her drive. But you know what I said, Thats really unfair. So I took out the polls, Time magazine, Drudge, good guy, Drudge, Drudge. We took out a lot of different things and we put up the Drudge poll, the Time magazine and many others. And some of them had to be down to like at 91% and they didnt have many people and I cant really show up because many of those people are now great friends of mine. Some of them are great Republican senators. Im not going to show results, but Im holding it up just quickly glancing. I call it a glancing blow, but we won the debates and I have this fake news person saying, Donald Trump did very poorly in the debates. I want every debate easily. I never did it before. Remember my first question I said, Rosie ODonnell. That was one of my best answers. Rosie ODonnell who violated the campaign finance laws as badly as anybody Ive ever seen and nothing happens to her. Right And yet jevich violate  He made a little mistake and they want to destroy him. So we pardoned him. We pardoned him. By the way, he made a mistake. Rosie ODonnell. That was a massive violation of the campaign finance laws but Dinesh, Dinesh, they wanted to put him in jail. I dont know. I think he mightve even gone to jail for a period of time for doing something that was really very understandable. Rosie ODonnell. Five times what she did is incredible. Nothing happens. And then she gets on and says, what a bad guy I am. Im not a bad guy, but its really a disgrace. You know, its a disgrace. Im glad they didnt do anything with it, frankly because you know what to do for something like that. But you know what We have two sets of justices in this country. Its no good. Its no good. Its no good. You know the thing were working on right now Were trying to get fairness for a certain person whos been treated very unfairly. A man who had a juror, who was a radical anti-Trump person, and she didnt say that when she went up there and she became the foreperson of the jury and she did terrible things and said terrible things. And you know how they caught her. When he was convicted and then a statement was made, she started jumping up and down screaming,  Yes, yes. And started telling everybody. They said, Wait a minute. Wasnt she just a juror The woman was totally biased. How do you do this So I fight. Look, I fight. A lot of times its not worth it, but I got to fight for fairness. I got to fight for fairness. Got to fight for fairness. Its a very unfair system. I guess its called the swamp. When I said drain the swamp, it was a nice phrase. I never liked the phrase. When I was campaigning, somehow the phrase came up, Sir, I think we have a phrase, drain the swamp. I said, I dont like it. Thats too hokey. But one day I was in a big arena, 25,000 people packed before the election and I said, And we will drain the swamp. The place went crazy. I said, Wow, you never know. You never know. Frank Sinatra said his best song. I wont tell you which one because Ill ruin it for you, but his best song is the song that he thought would never make it, the song that he liked the least, but he said thats the one that was the most successful that the people like you never know. So I said, Drain the swamp. And the people went crazy. I said, Woah. I said, Lets try that again. And the next time I did it again and again and again. I only didnt know how disgusting and dirty the swamp is and a lot of the media is a big part of the swamp. So my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. Were defending your right to keep your doctor and your plan. Were defending that right. Youre going to have that right back. Were going to cancel that Obamacare if we could win the case and were going to give you great healthcare and were making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office. Were managing it very well. We got rid of the individual mandate, by far the most unpopular thing where you had to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to pay for bad healthcare, right We got rid of it. And it was upheld in the Supreme Court, what we did. Whenever we get sued, everything we do, if we move, if we take 10 steps right or left, we get sued and were now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive. Were going to make healthcare a big part of this campaign. Were protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will. Thats why if we are successful, you dont want the Supreme Court to try and get rid of this, the caucus. Its a caucus known as Obamacare, but were running it much better than they did. Remember when they had, this was the greatest, the 5 billion website, right 5 billion. It was supposed to cost 5 million. I have a son at home. Hes 13. Hes a genius with computers. Hi, dad. Whats up Dead dad. Get out of here. Hey listen. Im the president of the United States, pal. Dont talk to your dad. Dad, Come on dad. Cant you see Im playing with my computer The guy talks to me and hes working with his computer. These guys are genius. You know, they grow up with like walking, right But hes looking at me. I could have given him their healthcare site. He would have done it for nothing and it would have been better than what they have. So remember, come on, dad. Im busy, dad. What do you want What do you want, dad Barron, woah. Wow, hes going to like that. Hes a good boy. Hes a tall boy. Ill tell you that. Just turned 13. Hes up there. Im saying, Hi Barron. How are you doing But theyre great with the computers. They spent 5 billion. Okay. It was going to cost 50. It was going to cost five. It was going to cost 50. Then it was going to .. What was the final number Five hundreds. The number that they spent, 5 billion. Right It still doesnt work. They spent 5 billion. Right And they spent 500 million on all of the problems it caused and weve really straightened it out, but its still lousy healthcare, Obamacare. And its really not Obamacare anymore because when you get rid of the individual mandate, its no longer Obamacare but were going to terminate it. Were going to give you your preexisting a hundred per- otherwise I wont do it. Were going to give you brand new preexisting and were going to have a great healthcare thats much less expensive. And were fighting to stop surprise medical bill and Barrons is going to be very happy. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very fast. You know, a man that does this very professionally is great, into the healthcare business and you have to be careful when you say it, but you know it was just a very strong statement. But he said, Sir, price transparency in hospitals. Where you can bid it out and you can look at the prices. Right now you cant see. If you go to a hospital, they wont even tell you how much its going to cost. They operate and then theyll give you a bill and youll say, Oh my god, I had no idea it could be. They take blood. We have one person, blood 39. Another place, the exact same thing, 2500. Take blood, a blood test. One is 39 one, is 2500. The same test. Maybe the 39 test is better. Who the hell knows But its crazy. Price transparency and he looks at me. He goes, and hes a real pro. One of the top in the country. He said, Sir, and nobody wanted to do it because its a little bit controversial and a lot of the drug companies dont exactly love it. The hospitals dont love it, but I got to do whats right for you. The people, I dont care, Im not. I got to do it. But he looked at me. And this is why I did it. It was one phrase. You know, do you ever do where youre not going to do something And then somebody hits you with a perfect phrase. He said, Sir, price transparency is bigger than healthcare. I said, What do you mean by that He said, You will see numbers that far outweigh healthcare, hospitals, doctors. He said, Youll be able to price out everything. Youll be able to see costs. He said, Price transparency. You know, people youve heard about this for 15, 20 years. No president has the guts to do it. Probably means I wont get campaign contributions from certain people, but Im not going to get them anyway. What the hell difference does that make I dont want them. I dont want them. I got to do whats right. You know, were here for a short period of time. Even if its a long period, its still a short period and weve got to do so. Price transparency is a big deal. He said its bigger than healthcare. Think of that. Bigger than healthcare. So lets see what happens. But thatll kick in. Unfortunately, that kicks in after the election because were going through the final stages. We going through a statutory process, unfortunately. So think of it, were going to win. But lets say the fake news could give me enough phony stories, enough bad stuff that we dont make it. The new president will get all the credit for price transparency and he wont even know what the hell it is. And I took the heat. Isnt that something But were going to win. We got to win for that reason alone. Weve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but a fraction of the cost. And that was another one. Tremendous political pressure. Think of it. You own Bayer aspirin. You own all these name name brand drugs that are making so much money. And then the guy comes along said, I want to make 20 forms of aspirin. Theyre exactly the same. Exactly. But they dont have a big name on it. Exactly as good. I dont say better. I dont say worse. Theyre exactly the same. You know, people still, they want to go out and buy the name. You know I do. I do. You know Because its just because were stupid. No, its true. Theyre exactly the same. Were approving so many of the generic drugs, a record number. Nobodys ever approved so much. The drug companies hate it. They hate it. Never happened like what were doing. We also took down the trial periods from 12 years down to five or six years. Theyd have a new drug. The thing was obsolete by the time it got approved. Weve passed a really spectacular thing that theyve been trying to get for 40 some odd years. Right to try. So you dont have to now go if you get, hopefully nobody in this room has those kind of problems. Right to try. And so now you go and you sign a waiver and you get everything. Its great. If youre terminally ill. If youre very, very sick, youre not going to make it. And you know why they didnt do it They wouldnt approve it because they didnt want to be sued. And they said, No, this could be dangerous. They said, The people are terminally ill, theyre going to die. Let them use the experimental drugs. Dont wait because they have another four or five years before they can come onto the market. And it turned out we are having such unbelievable results. And you know what else Some of those drug companies are now like it. That they fought me like crazy because its really showing if it works there, its really showing that it works. Its pretty amazing. Right to try and this is really something, brand new initiatives combating kidney disease and combating Alzheimers disease. Weve made a lot of progress. Weve made a lot of progress, Sheldon and were pursuing new advances in the neonatal research to care for Americas youngest patients, our babies, and breaking all records in so doing. All of the radical Democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb right up until the very moment of birth. This is why in my state of the union address, did you like it Good. Its a different kind of address. You know, we can go lots of different ways, right Presidential, not presidential. I was presidential. Totally. Youd have about three people standing here, but I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your very, very important second amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln, which everybody forgot. Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every single walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm. We are wealthy, right Are we enthusiastic You know how many of these Ive done in the last four days People say, Where the hell do you get your energy I say, Well, the truth is I like what I do and if we werent getting the results, I wouldnt like it. If we werent getting the results. If I didnt see the results, I wouldnt like it at all. Were welcoming Americans of all parties and political persuasions to join our incredible movement to make America great again. Were a very big party. We are the party of big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. Was never going to happen. We got it done. This could not have been done by anyone but the Republican party and ourselves. You know the Democrats have tried for years. They couldnt get it done. We got it done. To uphold the rule of law. We are confirmed and this is something they say. Most important thing you can do, judges. I say most important thing is defense. Second is judges. A record number of 217 federal judges who will interpret the constitution as written. And we have appointed two great new Supreme court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. I recognized Israels true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. We have invested 2.2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, including more than 130 million for Nellis air force base right here. And we just created the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force, 72 years, 72 years. The air force was 72 years ago. We just did a branch. Its a big deal, isnt it Think of it. A branch, the army, the air force. Think of it. We did a branch. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Nevada. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020 November 3rd. November 3rd. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that very beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic within nine years in America. And we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant its flag on Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And that is under siege in case you havent noticed. You know, your second amendment is under siege. Just dont worry. Long as Im here, theyre not touching it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for this. So true. But we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes and they are heroes. We love them, of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, in God we trust. From Carson city to Reno to right here in Las Vegas, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our great, beautiful, lovely freedom, freedom, freedom. Freedom. Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys who tamed the frontier, raised the mighty Hoover dam. Thats a beauty. Transformed the barren desert into a shining oasis, lit up the lights of the Las Vegas strip and help to make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Nevada, the best is yet to come together. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, Nevada. Thank you, Las Vegas. We love Las Vegas. Thank you everybody. Thank you."
NewMexico,Sep16,2019," Wow, thank you. Thank you, New Mexico. Thank you. We love being with you. We love being with you. Incredible people, incredible people. Thank you very much. And Im thrilled to be here in Albuquerque with thousands of hard-working, freedom-loving American patriots. Thank you. Incredible. Were all united by the same love of our great country. And by the way, our country is doing great. You see it. The same devotion to family and the same profound faith that America is blessed by, the eternal grace of Almighty God. Good night to that person. Tomorrow theyll say, Massive protest. No, one person just going home to mommy a little bit sooner. Good night. But were bound by these convictions. We will campaign for every vote, and we will win the great state of New Mexico in 2020. And by the way, you have thousands and thousands of people outside who cant get in. So we love you, we love you, we appreciate it. We try to get the biggest arena we can get, and theyre never big enough, frankly. So theres something going on. And I always say, 2016, I dont know if therell ever be another 2016. But right now its like a great tree or a great plant, you plant it and it has to take hold. We have to win 2020. Were doing so well. We have to win 2020. And every day, and you know as well as I do, were battling against the corrupt establishment of the past, and were achieving historic victories for the American people. Were winning again. Were winning again, and were winning big. Were winning big. Crucially for your state, we have ended the last administrations war on American energy. And since my election, natural gas productions, big story today, in New Mexico has increased by 40%, 4-0. And that means great wages, and it means jobs. And thats why youre breaking every single record in your states book. Crude oil production in New Mexico has more than doubled, and going up a lot higher very quickly. And your states energy revenues are up by nearly two-thirds. Think of that. Two-thirds. And thats in a short period of time. Give me a little bit more time, okay The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And this means more jobs, higher wages, and American energy independence, which is what we have. A few years ago, if we had a problem like you saw two days ago in the Middle East, we wouldve been in a panic. Although, not if I were your president. We never panic. We dont want to panic. But a few years ago, they would have been in a panic. Today we got a lot of oil, we got a lot of gas. We got a lot of oil and gas. We dont have to send too many boats over there. Did you notice the other day, they were saying, We dont see too many American ships anymore. You know why Because we dont need  Were independent, as independent as we want. And we are now a net exporter of energy. Revenues from energy production provide up to 25% of your states budget and going much higher in the very near future. And theyve generated nearly a billion-dollar budget surplus in New Mexico. Thank you very much, president Trump. Thank you. Now, under the Green New Deal, that all goes away. That all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car. Make it electric. Single car. Youre not allowed to travel more than 162 miles. Theyll call us the hermit nation. Well never leave our house. No, its crazy. But thats okay. I dont want to bring it up because I dont want to do it too early. Maybe theyll change, and I dont want them to change. But think of it for you, and for Texas, and for so many other places, they want to get rid of your energy. I mean, explain that one. Explain that. Yet, every major Democrat running for president, they want to abolish all production of oil and natural gas. In other words, the Democrats want to completely annihilate New Mexicos economy. The Democrats want us to be subservient to foreign producers. They want us to be at the mercy of rogue regimes. Thats not happening anymore. Its been a long time. Its been a long time. Its not happening anymore. But Democrats will never get the chance because New Mexico will never give them that chance. Under this administration, America is working again. America is winning again. And America is respected again, like it hasnt been for a long time. And I can tell you because I meet so many of the leaders, and their presidents, and their kings, and their queens, and their prime ministers, and their everything, dictators every once in a while. Every once in a while, you get an a rogue dictator. And Ill tell you, they always start off, today I had the Crown Prince of Bahrain, and they come in and they say, Sir, Id like to congratulate you on what youve done with the economy of the United States. Its a model for the entire world. They all say it. And earlier today  Do we have any baseball fans Right Right You know what Im going to say. But earlier today in the White House, I had the honor of awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom, thats the highest civilian award, to someone who truly embodies the American dream, baseball legend, the greatest, by the way, the greatest relief pitcher of all time, you look at those records, Mariano Rivera. He was something. The Yankees won a lot of World Series because of Mariano. Great guy. We gave him the medal. Done so much for charity. A fantastic man, fantastic family. It was a beautiful day at the White House, so it was good. My administration is fighting to empower all Americans to reach their dreams and achieve their potential. We have created six million new jobs since election day. The fake news would never have allowed us to say that during the campaign, even as a projection. Unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in over 50 years. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Nearly 600,000 Americans came into the labor force last month alone. Think of that. Wages in your state, New Mexico, are growing at a rate of much more than 3% a year, which is unheard of 20 years ago. And I used to say during the campaign, you go back, its hard to believe, Im here almost three years  Can you believe how time is flying Can you believe it I dont know about it me, but you look all much better than you did three years ago. Youre wealthier. And even with the Me Too movement, we cant say this, but Ill say it anyway, youre better looking, including the men, including the men. Now youre all looking good. Since my election, the number of new business applications for New Mexico has increased by almost 30%, more than any state in the United States. Think of that. More than any state in the United States. So essentially, thats saying youre in a certain category, which is a very important category, youre doing better than any state in the United States. How do I lose New Mexico Explain that one, right How do we lose that one And yet, for whatever reason, its been quite a while since a Republican won this state. But were going to win this state. And I think were going to win this state easy. You had to see the people all the way in from the airport. That was a long drive by the way, 35 minutes. That was a long drive. But all the way in, we had people, and they were waving. And I didnt see any negative hand gesture, right No, I think were going to do great here. And were here for a number of reasons, but were here because we really think were going to turn this state and make it a Republican state. Yesterday marked the beginning of the Hispanic Heritage Month. Who is Hispanic here Latinos for Trump. Thank you. Incredible people. But we have much to celebrate. Unbelievable when you think, the unemployment for Hispanic-Americans is right now at the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic-American poverty reached a brand new all-time low in history. And after years of stagnation that you know very well, wages for Hispanic-Americans are rising really fast, up nearly 8% since my election. Those are unheard of numbers. Theyre unheard of. And median income, think of that, median income for Hispanic-Americans surpassed 50,000 for the first time ever. Thats your median. Thats not bad. That means youre wealthy and youre getting wealthier fast. And I just want to tell you its an honor. But when Im on the debate stage debating one of these far left radical Democrats, whoever it may be, and they start telling you what theyre going to do for you, and you say, But we have the best numbers, every category, that weve ever had. Hispanic-Americans  excuse me, New Mexico as a whole, we have the best numbers. African-Americans, the best numbers that weve ever had in the history of our country. Asian-Americans, the best numbers that weve ever had in history. Women, the best numbers that weve had in 71 years. Were working night and day to deliver a future of limitless opportunity for our nations Hispanic-American citizens, including millions and millions of extraordinary Mexican-Americans who enrich our society, strengthen our country, serve in our military, and contribute immensely to our shared American family. And I want to just tell you that Mexico is doing a great job for us on the border, and I want to thank the president of Mexico. You know, its very interesting, I hear everybody screaming, well, you know were building the wall, and its going up, and its going up fast. And if you think thats easy with the Democrats who control the House, we have to take it back, but if you think its easy  But were building a lot of wall. Well have almost 500 miles of wall built by the end the next year, and its making a big difference. 500 miles. But you know we won a big case two months ago in the Supreme Court that allowed us to do what were doing. This has been  Ill tell you what. Ready Another president would have given up a long time ago. We dont give up. So were building the wall, the Army Corps of Engineers, were doing a beautiful job. Its a great, its a great structure. Its a great structure. Youre going to have to really want to get over that wall, to do it. But it was very interesting because, not too long ago, I saw where the Hispanic-American, the Hispanics, were up with me in a poll, 17%. And everyone said, How is that How is that How is that 17%. Up by 17%. I wont even tell you what the final number was because they wont believe it, but youre going to see what the final number  But you know why Because the Hispanic-Americans, they understand, they dont want criminals coming across the border. They dont want people taking their jobs. They want to have that security, and they want the wall. They want the wall. And we have a man in the audience who is, I think, the best dressed man in this entire place, including me, right here. Look at him. Come here. Look at him. Look at this guy. And hes been to a couple of rallies too, havent you Huh We have some people, a group of people the other day, you know, we had a victory in North Carolina that was unbelievable. Two of them. One of them, it was going to be very, very close. Heres another one of my friends. Thank you. I like that beautiful red tie youre wearing. But we had a victory, two victories, North Carolina, where one was 17 points down three weeks ago, we got involved, we started sending out lots of different social media messages, we did a couple of little robo calls, but the big thing, we did a speech the night before. The turnout was beyond belief. And instead of being down by 17 points, he easily won the election 4,000 or 5,000 votes. Dan, thank you, Dan. Thank you, Dan Bishop. And Greg Murphy was up a couple of points, and he ended up winning, I dont know, Id ask the media, but they wont give me how many  What did he get Do you know Like 20, 21 He won by a lot. He won by a lot. Id asked them, but were not going to get a straight answer. They were not happy. They were not happy. Ill tell you, Tuesday night, the fake news was not happy. They had their studios all built. CNN had their A- list talent. They dont have A-list talent, but they had the best they could have. And they were all set. This was going to be the end of Trump, because this man was going to lose. But he turned out to be tough and smart. And in all fairness, I helped a lot too. And toward the end of the night, they started dismantling that studio. Probably it would have been there for four weeks. This is the end. But we had two great victories, congressional victories, on Tuesday night. And it was something. The one gentleman won by a number that nobody thought even possible, so much. And the other won a race that he was way, way, way back. In fact, I shouldnt tell you this, but my geniuses, my people, some of those people standing right there, right there, some of them right there, they said, Sir, dont get involved in that race, sir. You cant come back from 17 points, sir. Its too much. I said, But you know, I really like the guy. I think hes great. Lets give it a shot. They say, Sir, if you lose, they will never, ever  Itll be much worse. I said, Let me tell you, I know them very well. Whether I help him or dont help him, its going to be the same. Its going to be a disaster. So lets help him. And we campaigned, and we worked hard, right They said, Dont do it, sir. Dont do it. Please dont do it, sir. Itll be very embarrassing. I said, No, I dont mind being embarrassed. I dont mind being embarrassed. Were also very proud that unemployment among Native Americans has reached the lowest rate in nearly two decades. And were building an amazing future for citizens of every background, race, religion, color, and creed. And thats what we have. Thats what we have. Race, religion, color, and creed. But the radical left Democrats want to demolish everything that weve gained. They want to raise your taxes. They want to bury you in regulation. They want to take away your health insurance, 180 million Americans. They want to erase American history, crush religious liberty, indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology. And left-wing Democrats want to confiscate your guns and eliminate your God-given right to self-defense. You know that. As your president, I will never allow them to take away your liberty, your dignity, and your social security. And I will never, ever allow them to take away your sacred right to keep and bear arms. The left tries to threaten, bully, intimidate Americans into submission. They use Democrat prosecutors and phony congressional committees whenever they can. Theyll do whatever they can to demean you, to libel you. They try to blacklist, coerce, cancel, or destroy anyone who gets in their way. Look at what theyre doing today to Justice Kavanaugh. Look at what theyre doing. Did you see the New York Times Did you see what theyre doing Did you see what Democrats, theyre calling for his resignation. Theyre calling for his impeachment. And the woman involved said she didnt know anything. But they still, so the New York Times had to put out a major apology, and they had to change their story. The woman said, I dont remember that. Can you believe And they still want him to be impeached. And I just put out a statement. And hes a great man, by the way, a great talent. A great brilliant man, Brett Kavanaugh. and I just put out a statement on social media that said, I dont think theyll do it, but they should, for the good of the nation, I call for the resignation of everybody at the New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh smear story. And while youre at it, the Russian witch-hunt hoax, which is just as phony a story. Theyve taken, the old gray lady, do you know the New York Times, for years, the old gray lady, so prestigious, theyve taken the old great lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue, and ruined her reputation. She can never recover, and will never return to greatness under current management. The Times is dead. Long live The New York Times. Long lived The New York Times. And I do want it to live, but they have to be, they have to change their ways. Think of it, they wrote a story about somebody that said she doesnt remember this. Can you even believe it And yet, all of these radical left crazies are in judiciary committee and all of these committees that are set up to hurt the country. With all that we have going, with Saudi Arabia, with Iran, with China trade deal, with Russia, with North Korea, with all that we have going, look at the cards that weve been dealt, lucky we won the election in 2016, believe me. With all that we have going, they say, Lets impeach Justice Kavanaugh, one of the smartest, most brilliant students, top at Yale, incredible life, incredible family. Lets impeach him. Its a made-up story. Lets impeach President Trump. Think of that. The Muller Report came out. Think of this. This crazy Mueller Report comes out, 18 Trump haters, liberal Democrats, some worked for Hillary Clinton, they found nothing. No, think of it. After two years, they found nothing. They spent 40 million. Theres not a person in the room that I couldnt find something on with that. They spent, think of it, they found nothing. No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing. To stop the far lefts campaign of destruction, you must vote Republican. And youre going to get the chance very soon. Were joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and somebody thats done an incredible job, she ran Michigan for me. And as you know, for the presidential races, Michigan hadnt been won in decades, and she kept saying, Could you come back, sir I didnt know who she was. I said, Who the heck is the woman in Michigan that keeps asking She said, Sir, if you keep coming back, youre going to win Michigan. Hasnt been won in decades. And I won Michigan. Remember that great, great night November. That great, great night. Donald Trump has won the great state of Michigan. And they were going crazy on television. They were going, that was not a good night- Going crazy on television. They were going, that was not a good night for certain people. Remember the couple of people that were crying I guess they dont like a strong military. They dont like cutting regulations. They dont like low taxes. They dont like Right to Try, you know Right to Try. All these things weve done. For the Vets, we got choice. We got choice for the Vets. Choice. Everybody said it was impossible. Weve rebuilt our military. I told this story for the first time today. A general came into my office in my first few weeks, you remember It was a little dangerous out there. President Obama left us with a few beauties, right And I said to this general, You better be prepared, because this is looking like it could really be conflict. And he looked at me and he goes, Sir, we have very little ammunition. I said, Say it again. And I want to tell you the words, very little, he didnt use because it was less than that. And I said, I never want to see a president in a position like that, where we may have conflict, and a general looks at him and said, We have very little/ no ammunition. I never want a president of the United States to be in that position. And since then, three years, 700 billion weve spent, then 716 billion. And now, 738 billion. And our military is by far the greatest in the world. Theres nobody that even comes close. So anyway, no president should ever be put in that position. And by the way, no president should ever have to go through what Ive gone through either. That should never happen. What happened is a disgrace to our country. No president should ever have to go through it. And Ill tell you what, 99% of them would never have been able to take it. They wouldnt have been able to take it. But we won the great state of Michigan, and now were doing really well, because weve moved a lot of car companies. I tell Japan, sorry, big deficits with all these countries, were changing it, but youve got to get car companies. Were building car companies now in Michigan. Theyre not going to be leaving for lots of other countries, including China, including Mexico. Theyre going to stay home, and theyre going to pay you a lot of money, and everybodys going to be happy. But Michigans doing great. And Ronna McDaniel was the Republican Party chair of Michigan. So when we won the election, I said, Lets get the woman from Michigan to run the RNC. And she has done an incredible job. Thank you Ronna. A great gentleman who loves the Republican Party, co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. Tommy, what a job. New Mexico Republican party chairman. Steve Pearce. My friend and a really talented guy, he just gets the hell knocked out of him all the time. Brad Parscale. What a job hes doing, Brad. Great job, Brad. Great job. And another great friend of mine, somebody that was on CNN, and they didnt like him because he was too positive on Trump. Can you believe it He happens to be Hispanic. He happens to be Hispanic, but Ive never quite figured it out, because he looks more like a wasp than I do. So I havent figured that one out. But Ill tell you what. There is nobody that loves his country more or Hispanic more than Steve Cortez, Steve. Thank you Steve. Nobody loves the Hispanics more. Who do you like more, the country or the Hispanics He says the country. I dont know. I may have to go for the Hispanics to be honest. We got a lot of Hispanics. We love our Hispanics. Get out and vote. You know, just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote, close to 90%. they gave me the Bay of Pigs award. Can you imagine, right The Bay of Pigs award. And the Venezuelans and the Cubans are all for Trump, I will tell you that. Theyre all for Trump. They like what were doing. With the help of, and Steve, I want to thank you very much by the way, and you were incredible on CNN, and now youll get a real job. Okay Steve, that audience wasnt big enough for you. Their ratings arent good. With the help of everyone here tonight, were taking power out of Washington and giving it back to the great people of our country, and to the people of New Mexico. Weve cut a record number of job-killing regulations, saving the average American household 3,000. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. What that means is a typical family of four in New Mexico making 75,000 has seen their tax bill reduced by more than 2,000. And its one of the reasons that as the world is not doing great, you look at Europe, and you look at Asia, and Chinas not doing too well. I must be honest with you, worst year in 57 years, Id say thats not good. But I hope they still like me. And weve taken in tens of billions of dollars worth of tariffs, and weve given those tariffs, and by the way, Chinas eating the tariffs, theyre devaluing their currency, the prices are very similar. Theyre eating the tariffs. And out of the tens of billions we gave our great farmers, because they were targeted by China, because China knows, very smart, that the farmers love Trump, and Trump loves the farmers. I said to our Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, I said, Sonny, how much did the farmers get hit by China targeting them and pulling back and doing all sorts of things He said, 16 billion. I said, Thats okay. Well take 16 billion out of a much, much, much larger number. Were going to give it to the farmers, so that theyre even. And I tell you, the farmers do love Trump, they do love Trump. And to keep New Mexicos farms, ranches, and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax, so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children. Now, if you dont like your children, dont do it. But when its your time to kick the bucket, you worked hard. You have great kids, you love your kids, theyre taking care of you. You really love them. Its a great thing. If you dont love them, dont even listen to the last line, because it wont matter. Dont leave it to them. If theyre not good, leave it to charity. Leave it to something else. Dont get it to them. I know a guy who cant stand his children, theyre horrible, horrible human beings. Theyre a little older now, but theyre horrible human beings. He wants to leave his wealth. I said, Why would you leave them They dont even like you. But on the assumption that you love your children, youll be able to use small farms and your ranches and things. Youll be able to leave them to your children. Your children wont have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay tax. They wont be losing it to the banks five years later. We got rid of it. Thats a big deal. Thank you. Thank you. Our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100% pro-American. For many decades, our leaders put global interests and special interests ahead of your interests. You know that, in New Mexico, you know exactly what Im talking about. People came in, they took your jobs, they had no border, they had no border control. Look at whats going on now, how were doing. I mean, honestly, I mentioned the president of Mexico. We have today 27,000 Mexican soldiers on the border protecting our country. And Ill take it. Because our laws are so bad, theyre so pathetic. And the Democrats could change these laws. They could change them so quickly. We could change them all in less than an hour. We could, whether its asylum, whether its any of the laws, we have so many of them that are so bad. How they got that, it took years and years to end up. But we have the Mexican soldiers out there. You see them, and theyre stopping people. The numbers are plummeting down. So I just want to thank all of the representatives of Mexico. Amazing. Well, weve got to get rid of the loopholes. You know, the word is loopholes, and the Democrats could do it fast. But in the meantime, were doing really well. And as the wall goes up, it becomes less and less of a problem, because as the wall gets up, people arent getting through. I mean you got to be a a world class pole vaulter, or a world class Mount Everest type climber. Theres not too many around like that. Its really doing the trick. The failed liberal establishment in Washington squandered your tax dollars, shipped away your jobs, sacrificed your sovereignty, and bogged us down in one foreign war, or debacle, call it whatever you want after another. And thats changing also, you see whats happening, and when these rich countries think were going to pay for their military every year, billions and billions and billions, and theyre rich, and they take our business and were supposed to, on top of everything else, I could tell you stories, but Im going to save them for the campaign. Because to be honest, this is a little earlier than the campaign. Wait until this campaign starts, you know, like I was telling Brad and I was telling a few of the folks, one thing I dont want to do, Michael back there, Michael, hello. What a job hes done. But Im telling them I dont want to do this too early. I dont want to do it. You know the Pocahontas thing, I did that, it was before its time. Right It was before its time. Too early. 1,024. That means I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none, unfortunately. Id like to say I have a lot. Got to get me another 4%. maybe another 10%. but I was early with her, and frankly, oh its coming back, dont worry about her. But those days are over under this administration. We are finally putting America first. Putting it first. Were reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that ravished our industries and devastated communities all across our land. You see the factories, empty buildings, empty hulks. Some have been demolished, some have been reconverted into senior citizen housing and housing. But all those jobs are gone, and were bringing them back. Theyre coming back like almost never before. Probably, I can say theyre coming back like never before. People are coming back now, because they want to be where the action is. And this is the country where they have the security, and where they do have the action. In my first week in office, I proudly withdrew from the last administrations job-destroying and this was a catastrophe. You know, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, this would have destroyed the automobile business in our country. Now New Mexico, you know that you were totally devastated by another disaster known as NAFTA. Your state lost 33% of its manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was signed. This was one of the great catastrophes. And now were replacing NAFTA with the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA. Think of the song YMCA. YMCA. Think of the song. USMCA, thats US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. And its drawing strong Bipartisan support from all across your state, and all across the country. Its amazing. I want to just, yeah. the Dona Ana County Board of Commissioners, all Democrats just unanimously endorsed the USMCA, and urged Congress to pass it immediately. Thank you very much commissioners. All Democrats. Hopefully theyll put it up for a vote. Nancy Pelosi, they put it up for vote. Its going to be very popular. The Republicans love it, and the Democrats love it, and frankly, labor loves it. Unions love it. Farmers love, love, love it, and everybody wants it. Your farmers, your ranchers, everybody wants it. Its an incredible agreement. And Mexicos already passed it, and Canadas ready to pass it, soon as we do. See, they dont maybe trust us, thats why. They say, Why arent you passing it now They say, Oh, well pass it. Theyre going to pass it as soon as we do. Past leaders invited China to freely loot and pillage the United States economy. Chinas been taking out from 300 billion to 500 billion a year. Billion, not million. Billion. Think of what 500 billion is. Weve rebuilt China, but now its a different ball game. Somebody had to do something with China. President Obama should have done it. Presidents Bush should have done it. President Clinton should have done it. They all should have done it. Frankly, they all should have done a lot of things that were doing right now. So if you look at it, nobody did it, so Im doing it, and thats whats going to happen. Were doing well. So now were taking in billions and billions of dollars from China. When in the past, we never got 25 cents. We never got money. We never got anything. You know what we got Unemployment and losses. And some cheap pencils. More than we needed. You could do with one less pencil. Following decades of outsourcing and offshoring, our jobs and factories are coming back home where they belong. If foreign companies do not want to pay our tariffs, there is one very simple solution. Come and make your product in America. Come and make your product in New Mexico. And by the way, Im just seeing this great group of people, this spirit, is there any place in the world thats more fun or more exciting than a Trump rally Really Is there anything When you think about it, its not about fun. Its about achievement. Because what weve achieved in the last almost three years is unparalleled. Theres never been an administration that in the first two and a half years has done what weve been able to do or achieve. In a few short weeks, well be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges including court of appeals judges. Because President Obama did us a great favor when I came in, I said, I assume I have no judges to appoint. No sir, you have 138 judges. 138 Didnt put them up, couldnt get them approved. I dont know what happened, but we started off with 138, now were up to 180. I just signed my 150th federal judge, and court of appeals judge, and we already have two great Supreme Court justices, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh. Great, great men. So think of that. You know, you come in, and Ive always heard the most important thing a president does, I disagree with this by the way, but thats okay. I disagree with a lot of things. Because I think the most important thing is our military, and protecting our country, right But have you listened to the so-called Washington elite, now why are they elite We do better than they do, were smarter than them. We make more money, we have better houses, we have better everything, and then they say the elite. That means youre the super elite. Ive always take offense when somebody said, President Trump is tired of listening to the elite. I said, No, no, Im more elite than them. Right I think so. I mean, if we go by the old standards, better houses, better schools, made much more money, lived better, had everything going, and then I decide to run for president. And Ill be honest, while we have to put up with these people, and others are, its incredible. But its the greatest single decision Ive ever made, because our country is turning around so rapidly. I could not be happier, despite what they put us all through. Could not be happier. After years of building up other countries, were finally building up our country. Isnt that nice Its time to finally take care of our own. And were all so aggressively combating the opioid epidemic, which is horrible. And as a result of our nonstop efforts, and billions and billions of dollars invested, last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths, and it was a very big decline in nearly three decades. 30 years. And at the center of Americas drug crisis, this is where the Hispanics know it better than anybody. People said, Oh, the Hispanics wont like a wall. I said, I think theyre going to love it. They wont like border security. I think they going to love it. You know why Because you understand it better than other people, but at the whole center of this crisis is the drugs that are pouring in, and you understand that when other people dont understand it. The border crisis, every day dangerous criminal cartels smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across your Southern border, including heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl, and were stopping them now. You see the kind of numbers, were getting millions and millions and millions of dollars worth. Weve had some shipments where it could kill half of the country, some of the fentanyl and some of the bad, really bad stuff. If it were distributed, it could actually, has the power to kill half of the country. This is like a warlike situation. Thats why youre liking Trump, because youre not going to let that happen. If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic and they traffic really for the most part in women, thats what they traffic in, its women. Theyre not trafficking in men. They capture women, and they bring them across the open borders, and they dont go through ports of entry, where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas, and they hang a left, or they hang a right and they come in, but now when you have a wall, they cant do that. Right They cant do that. And so many of these Democrats that are against the wall, its common sense Look, you know what I saw the other day Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention, they just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what its for Theyre building a big wall around the building, theyre building a big wall. A massive wall. We should tell them, open borders. Let anybody come in. And a few years ago, almost every one of these, theyre on tape. Thats the problem with politics. Three years ago, they could say, look, I saw Senator Schumer, I saw Nancy I saw all of them. They said, No, we need a wall. We must have a wall. President Obama, We must have a wall. We must stop people from coming into our country illegally. We have to stop it. We need a wall. Now, a few years later, they dont want a wall. You know why Because anything I want, they want to do the opposite. And thats okay. Thats the only reason. But if you want to stop the drug smugglers, human traffickers and vicious MS-3 gang members, which were taking out every year by the thousands, and getting them the hell out of our country, because of ICE. And if you want to stop all these people from threatening our communities and poisoning our youth, you know its poisoning our youth. Thats what it is, its nothing other than that, its very simple. Theyre poisoning our youth. You have only one choice. You must elect Republicans. And to be honest with you, youve got to elect President Trump. We need four more years. President Trump. How about these phony Democrats They started with Russia, Russia, Russia. That turned out to be be a fraud. That turned out to be a fraud. Then they went to race. Do you believe that one Race. Im the least racist person in this room. Then they went to recession, theres going to be a recession. Oh please, let there be a recession, please. Because we have a better chance of defeating him if theres a recession. And unfortunately, the stock markets only a few points from its all time high, which weve broken on, I think its well over a hundred times. We broke the all time record. And now they have a new one. And Im enriching myself. Let me tell you, by doing this and taking this particular job, which I love, it will cost me billions and billions of dollars, but if somebody from the Middle East that I never saw before, comes in and stays in one of my hotels for an evening, and pays 439, emoluments. Nobody ever heard the word emolument before. Emolument, nobody ever heard that word, emolument. Hes enriching himself. If somebody buys a tank of gas in Scotland, from an airport that I dont own, and they happen to go to a hotel, hes enriching himself, like 20 people, Im going to lose billions of dollars, and thats okay. I expected to do that when I did it. I didnt know what would happen if I lost. Can you imagine Supposing I lost, and we would have had the same basic rhetoric. I mean, winning was great. Supposing, you know, Im doing all the things. Im telling you all the same sort of things. Supposing I didnt make it. Id have to go around. I wouldve lost and lost billions, then I would have been really unhappy. But Ill tell you what, I expected that when I did this, in terms of opportunity, in terms of certain places, they can never do as well when you have this kind of rhetoric, they can never do. So Ill lose billions of dollars, always expected. They say, I enrich myself because somebody is going to stay at my hotel. It doesnt work that way folks. And these are very, very dishonest people, and they know it. So theyve given up on every other hoax, but it doesnt work that way. You know it too. You get it. The democrat agenda of open borders places vast burdens on your communities, and your schools, and your hospitals, and public safety all at the expense of hardworking New Mexico families, and throughout our country. Sheriffs, and commissioners from nine Mexico counties recently sent a letter to your states congressional delegation begging them to vote for strong border security they want in New Mexico. They dont want open borders. They dont want criminals pouring into your communities, and doing what they do, and we wont even talk about that. They want strong, these are people that are with you in many cases, Democrats. They write letters, we need strong border security. In San Diego, California is very difficult. Always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego, good mayor in San Diego by the way. They wanted a wall. And I said, You know what, lets build it someplace else. Because California, you know, once we build it, theyll complain. But then I said, You know, the people are pouring in. They needed it. Theyre pouring into San Diego, like going all over the place. And people that had houses, they didnt like people running over their gardens all day long, coming in from the other side. So we put up a wall, and I thought everybody would be happy. As soon as it was finished, the day it was finished, I was notified. We didnt want the wall. Why did you do the wall And I will tell you, in other words, its all a game. Id love to take the sucker down and move it right now to New Mexico. And if I did that, theyd go crazy. And theyd say, Please sir, dont do that. Please, please. The same people that are saying, We dont want a wall. Why did you put up a wall And I knew that was going to happen. I told my people that was going to happen. But theyre very happy with their wall. Most of them wont say it. They love it. It stopped it only stopped 99.9% of the people coming in. And the only reason Im not moving it to New Mexico is that it would cost more money to move it than to build you a brand new, beautiful wall, so Ill give you a brand new beautiful wall.  New beautiful wall, Ill give you a brand-new one. Its true. Its true. I actually priced it out. Its true. These contractors, all my life Ive been deal They can find a way to make money. Sir, itll cost more money to move the wall that they built a new one. They have it, but the commission your commissioners wrote, I quote, Our communities do not have the resources nor the budgets to handle the massive influx of immigrants we are experiencing. This is your commissioners writing to us in Washington. Our scarce resources are in danger of being rapidly depleted to the point that we will be unable to effectively care for our own citizens, you, and our existing homeless populations, many of whom are American veterans, right So, Democrats put illegal aliens before American citizens. Republicans believe that we must take care of our own citizens first. Im sorry. That includes millions of hardworking, lawful immigrants who waited in line, followed the rules, and came into our country legally. And among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are Hispanic Americans who obey our laws, pay their taxes, contribute to our communities and play by the rules, and theyre the ones that want to see something done and we are doing it at a level that nobody else would be capable of doing it. Whether youre a first generation or a 10th generation, every American citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs, your safety, your family, and is always loyal to you. Your politicians have not been loyal to you. They have been loyal to themselves. The Democrats are also trying to turn every city in America into a sanctuary for criminal aliens, and thats one of the very good reasons we won on Tuesday night, North Carolina, because they let people out of their sanctuary city and what those people did, I will not tell you tonight, but it wasnt good. Its one of the reasons we had big victories, two of them in North Carolina, sanctuary cities. And plenty of people, even in California where they have sanctuary cities, they dont want sanctuary cities. The politicians do, but they dont want them. Right here in New Mexico, Democrats are trying to turn you into a total sanctuary state, creating a safe harbor for dangerous criminal aliens and gang members that sanctuary policies release from jail. Now, think of it. They want to make your whole state a sanctuary state. So, when MS-13 comes in, and I told you before, we take them out by the thousands and theyre tough. Theyre tough, but our ICE folks are even tougher. Theres nobody tougher. I would say naive, but maybe its much worse than that. Theyre naive, these politicians. The naive politicians, they dont want ICE to come in. They dont want to take these criminals out. And if you dont take them out and theyre in New Mexico, I got to tell you something, folks. You got problems. You got problems. Youve got big problems. Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. And Republicans will always support the heroes of ICE, border patrol and our great law enforcement. The Democrat party Do you notice I always say the Democrat party You know, before I came, they were all calling it Democratic because it sounds better, right It does. Its much nicer. The Democratic party is much nicer than the Democrat party, but their name is the Democrat party, and Im not looking for them to sound nice. I want to give their name. So, I always say the Democrat party, but thats their name, the Democrat party. Frankly, they should probably change it because it does And then Id call them the Democratic party, but the Democrat party has never been farther outside the mainstream. Every major Thats a nasty fly. I dont like those suckers. I dont know about you in New Mexico, but Im not into flies or mosquitoes. I dont like snakes too much. We have plenty of them in New York and Washington, a different variety. I dont like snakes either. We got a lot of snakes in Washington DC. We got a lot of steaks in New York. I dont like either kind of snake. I think I like the kind on the ground better than the ones we have in Washington. Every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would destroyed Medicare as we know it today. My administration will protect Medicare and defend your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. The Republicans will always do that. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 50 years. You dont hear this because the fake news doesnt want to write about it. Sometimes Ill have a news conference about something thats so good and Ill say, you know Ill call my wife, first lady, first lady. People love our first lady. Ill say, Wait until you see television tonight, and we did something that was so great, whatever it may be. We did a lot of things. We did something so great and it wont be on, but if theres something thats just slightly negative or even if its good that they could turn negative, thats what they like best. Take something good and turn it negative. Its breaking We have breaking news. We have breaking news. These are phony people, but thats okay. You know, when you think of it, Im president and theyre not. Crazy. Its crazy. You know, sometimes Ill be in the oval office and Ill be with my people. We have great people, and Ill say, You know, and its great comm in the oval office. You dont like to hear about it because you dont hear about it too much. Thats not what they But we have great comm considering its pretty wild stuff going on in the world, right But Ill be saying, You know, they dont treat us right. They dont treat us right. Its not fair. Its not this. And then Ill just sit back, Ill say, But were in the oval office and theyre not. Its pretty amazing. Its pretty amazing. And when you have the Democrat party and the press, the media, the lame stream media, the fake news, and theyre partners They are partners, okay Remember the word Manufactured They used the word manufacturer on something, never been used for that thing, and every news gets The manufactured crisis started. The next one, This crisis was manufactured. Every one of them used the word Manufactured. They know what Im talking about now. Now, thats called collusion, folks. Thats real collusion. You have that, and so you have the Democrats, you have the media, their partners. Then you have the deep state. Were getting rid of a lot of them. Ill tell you, were finding them left and right. Boom. You take a look at what Ill tell you what. Ill tell you what. You take a look at what were doing with all of the things. Im not going to get into detail, but you know what Im talking about. Clean the swamp. Thats the ultimate cleaning of the swamp. And then I hate to say this, but we have some Republicans, theyre not good. You call them a rhino. Theyre rhinos. The rhinos are worse, and some of them are worse than the Obama people, right Theyre worse than the Obama people. Theyre worse than the Clinton people, but there arent too many of them left. Theyre pretty much on respirators. Theyre gasping. Theyre gasping for air, but we do have some bad people that you wouldnt believe. I didnt hear you. Why did you say why What I didnt hear that. Virtually, every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers right up until the moment of birth, and thats why Ive asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Its true. Right I see it. Just like mom, I see it. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, and socialism. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it is the party of the American dream. Weve achieved record funding for the US military. All of that money, trillions and trillions of dollars spent all produced right here in the good old USA. And I have to tell you, New Mexico, I know youre going to like this. A lot of those trillions because you know when you do the 716 and the 730 and the 700 -billion, all of a sudden youre in trillions and I can save a lot of lines when I just say trillions. A lot of that moneys going to be spent in the state of the art military equipment thats being used at Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range, Kirkland Air Force Base and many other vital New Mexico military installations that are going up as we speak. Thats also jobs, but more importantly than even jobs, incredible. What youve done for the military, New Mexico, is incredible and weve remembered, but were pouring a lot of money into New Mexico and that means a lot of good things. And were investing in our nations nuclear security, including right here in New Mexico and Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory. To protect American security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It was no good and we oppose the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian regime. Watch how that works out, folks. Thatll be very good. I recognized Israels true capitol and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And dont forget what I did for Israel with respect to Golan Heights. Dont forget, right For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for New Mexico. And you must never forget. Get out there and vote and get ready and get everybody. We need it because were fighting a lot of forces, including Facebook, I saw, and Google, I saw. Did you see Google He said I may have lost two-million to 10-million votes, according to this character that worked at Google, right And we still won. How the hell did we win Everybody was against us. How did we win How did we win This is a Google executive. From two-million to 10.5-million votes, and we won. I dont know, we must be doing I will say this. That happened and people came from the valleys. They came from everywhere. They Came from places that nobodys ever talked about before and it was the forgotten men and women, but the truth is I know these men and women and theyre the most incredible men and women in this country. They really are. They just never had anybody they really wanted to vote for or at least for a long time, they didnt want to get out there. They said, Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Is this the best they can do I mean, in all fairness, I dont want to go too early here. Look at the field. Did you watch the debate the other day Weve got almost 350-million people. Ill take it. Thats the best they can do. Well see. Well see. You never want to get too cocky. Somebody said in the great state of Texas, Donald Trump is down two points to Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Theyre phony polls. You know they have phony polls. I told this story the other night. For six months, I was hearing that Im going to lose the state of Texas and friends of mine from Texas that look just like these guys. See these two guys with the hates They might even be better looking. They look just like And they want to say, I dont know about you, but I know a lot about Texas and Donald Trump is not going to be losing the state of Texas. Remember that See, they dont say its in play. Theyre too smart. They say Texas is in play. And Utah, they said was it play. All these are in play and play means we could lose them, right Its a better term though because this way, they cant get skunked, but they can get skunked with me. So, what happens is on that beautiful election Was that one of the greatest, coolest nights ever Well, they can never call a victory unless you absolutely have it and unless youre winning by a lot. This is six months. Texas is in play. You know, he could lose Texas. I keep saying, I go to a stadium, we sell out to thousands of people, lines that are miles long. I mean, and every friend of mine says, Youre going to win by a lot. 00, whatever time, The polls in Texas are closed. Donald Trump has won this state of Texas. The polls in Utah are closed. Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. They dont even take a breath. Now, if its close like its in play, you wait two, three, four or five hours to see what it is, but they dont even a breath because theyre called suppression poles and theyre no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people see. Theyre no different. Theyre suppression polls, and Ill tell you what. Were going to win the state of New Mexico and Ill be so surprised if we dont. Ill be so surprised. No, were going to win New Mexico. You know, when I came here during the last election, came here a little because I was told very hard to win and I came here a little, but I saw great spirit. But I didnt really have a track record because I never did this stuff before. So, I said I was going to cut your taxes. I did. I said I was going to cut your regulations. I did more than any president in history and theyve been there for many years. Ive been there for two and a half. And I think the regulation cutting Like the Waters of the US, that was another beauty where you couldnt build a house, you couldnt farm your land. Now, what weve done on regulations is incredible. Ive done Ive rebuilt our military, Ive taken care of our vets. Look how happy our vets are with choice. Instead of waiting for two months to see a doctor or two weeks or three days, they now go out. If theres a wait, they go out, they get a private doctor. They get taken care of. We pay the bill. And for the first time, theyve tried to get that for 45 years, they havent been able to get it, but Im good at getting things. You must never forget. The 2020 election is about one thing. Whats it about Its about you. It is. Its about you. Its about you. Im doing a good job as your messenger, but basically Im a messenger. I know what you want. I understand that its about your family. Its about your future, and its about the fate of your country for your children, for everybody. Its about the fate of your country. Its about the future of our great country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream. Thats what its about. Look at Venezuela. Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world and today, very sad. No food, no water, no nothing. Socialism. We begin this campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for America. And its not just a little bit positive. Our country is going to be greater than it ever was. Thats where were headed. Together, we will help millions more citizens know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job really well done. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and very lawful system of immigration. And were going to have a lot done anyway. We already do have a lot done. You saw the figures last week, but were doing it the hard way. It would be so much easier with a little stroke of the pen. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, that incredible phrase, Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years, and weve already started that program. It will happen. We have the medicine. Nobody even knew that. The AIDS epidemic in this country will be gone within 10 years. Weve already started the process. Its been funded. Its been funded. Who wouldve thought that Honestly, when I ran, I didnt know that. We have now the technology and what theyve done with respect to AIDS is incredible. What a terrible, terrible period of time the world went through, but we will have it ended within 10 years. We will defeat the effort to drive up the cost of houses, cars, healthcare, light bulbs. Right They took away our light bulb. I want an incandescent light. I want to look better, okay I want to pay less money to look better. Does that make sense You pay much less money and you look much better and on top of that, with the new bulbs, if they break, its considered a hazardous waste site. Its all gases inside and youre supposed to bring it back to where you bought it in a sealed container. Give me a break. I asked the people, the professionals, Well, what do people do when it breaks Because they break all the time. What do they do Nothing, they throw it away. A lot of people didnt know. They didnt understand. You got a much better light at a much reduced cost and its much safer because when those other bulbs break, they really are dangerous. The gases come out, theyre dangerous. These are the little things that I have to explain. Otherwise, people will say, What the hell are you doing with light bulbs for And were trying to do the same thing with cars. Cars have so much junk on them now to save a tiny little fraction of gasoline. They have so much junk that theyre less safe. So, what I want to do is the following. Under our rules and regulations, the cars are environmentally terrific, but theyre safer and theyre 3,500 less to buy, right And the reason theyre safer is because they could be a little bit heavier. Makes sense, right They could be a little bit heavier. I mean, they make them now like paper mache. Somebody touches them and the entire car collapses. When somebody hits me, I want to be in as close to an army tank as possible. No, theyre made out of paper mache. They weigh about three pounds and if you get hit by a bus, its over. They say, What happened to that car No, I think of it, its safer and its less expensive by 3,500 on average. And California wants you to do the other cars and we dont. Were going to end up in a big litigation and Im fighting for you. Look. Look, its not the kind of thing most presidents would be fighting for because they say, Let them pay more. Let it be unsafe. They listen to the environmentalists, and Im an environmentalist. I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know, right now, we have the cleanest air that weve ever had in this country But what are they going to do about China and India and Russia and other countries that are spewing stuff What are we doing about them Were going to keep our nation clean. But you know, the universe is so big that when you talk about China, the USA, India, you talk about these different places where a lot of bad stuff comes out, right Its so big that its right next to each other. Its right next to each other. Does that make sense Right Its right next to each other. So, what are they going to do We want to have the cleanest water and the cleanest air. We will defend privacy. We will defend free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and we will always defend your second amendment and were doing it now. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that mothers and fathers, not Washington bureaucrats, know best how to raise their strong, beautiful families in their loving and wonderful communities. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will always live by the words of our national motto. Nobody will ever take it down. Nobody will ever take it down. We will never allow them to take it down. In God we trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are going to be better than ever before and it wont even be close, and were right there. Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered sciences, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world. And every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to each and every one of you. Right With your help, your devotion and your drive  Gee, its too bad. He did it right in the crescendo. How do you top that I just readied the big beautiful crescendo and this characters going back home. Its all right. Its two people tonight. Remember, when they say Massive protest at the Trump rally, two people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning in a win like never before. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of the great state of New Mexico, we love you. The best is yet to come. Best is yet to come. Thank you, New Mexico. And together, we will make America wealthy again. Very, very wealthy. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. New Mexico. Thank you. Thank you, New Mexico. Thank you. Thank you."
ColoradorSprings,Feb20,2020,"Hello Colorado. We love Colorado, most beautiful place And Im thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs. Ive spent a lot of time here over the years. Beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks, thats true, of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great American patriots. With your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide. And youre going to help us get Cory Gardner across that line because hes been with us 100%. there was no waiver. Hes been with us. There was no waiver with Corey. We appreciate it. Thank you Corey. Thank you. This month we mark a very special anniversary. 75 years ago this week our brave United States Marines landed on the shores of Iwo Jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war. It was a rough one. Tonight its our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the Battle of Iwo Jima, James Blaine, Donald Whipple and John Thurman. Great, great patriots, very brave people. Just passed away. Sadly he passed away just a few days ago. He was going to be here. Passed away a few days ago, but he was great. I have a beautiful picture of him right outside and were going to honor him and his family. Great, great gentlemen. So we were going to have four. We have three and we want to thank you for being here. Thank you all. Thank you. Because America is truly a land of heroes, on behalf of the grateful nation I would like to recognize the many veterans of the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who are here this evening, and a lot of them. Great people, great people. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy in our history, the most prosperity of any country. We are doing better than any country in the world, that is not even close. And weve rebuilt our military over the last three years. Dont tell anybody, but we spent two and a half trillion dollars. But when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we dont worry about budgets, right We dont worry about budgets. We had to rebuild it. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. It was old, it was tired. We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment. Now we have brand new jets. We have brand new missiles and rockets. We have everything all made in the USA. In my State of the Union Address, I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. Thats what were doing. Our country is stronger today than ever before. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat crusades, the radical lefts attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed. They have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers weve ever had today, just came out. And I dont know if anybody watched last nights debate, it got very big ratings and you know what Mini Mike didnt do well last night. I was going to send him a note saying its not easy doing what I do, is it Its not easy, Mike. Not easy for any of them. Now, Mike didnt do too well. He went way down. Its all right. Mini mike. How about Klobuchar, did you see her She choked. She choked. She couldnt breathe. Alfred E. Neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said, Are you accusing me of being dumb Who would make a statement like that Because thats really what he was doing, but he doesnt want to say that. No, how about that Are you saying Im dumb That was the end of her campaign in my book. You dont say that. Even if its true, you dont say that. They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows. I tell you, Fox doesnt treat us the way they used to. But we have the great Sean Hannity, we do, and we have Laura and Tucker. And we have in the morning Fox and Friends, Steve and Ainsley, and Brians gotten much better, hes moving up. And we have the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs says hes the greatest president ever. The great Lou Dobbs. He says, Lou Dobbs a year and a half, two years ago he said, Hes the greatest since Reagan. Then he said about six months ago, Hes better than Reagan. And then he said a few nights ago, Hes the greatest weve ever had. I said, Does that include Lincoln and George Washington He said, That includes them all. Thats Lou Dobbs. The great Lou Dobbs. And youve got Hegseth and youve got Jesse Waters. How about Jesse And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld. Greg hated us, right But now he says, Look, whether I like him or not, he gets it done. Its all about getting it done. Were getting it done. Nobodys ever done what weve done. No, but Fox says, and I dont know, its different. It was different. In the old days, it was better for us. It was better for us. But its okay, well win anyway. No, but they had this woman on. Neil Cavuto, doesnt treat us good. Neil Cavuto, hes not too good. She said, I dont like him. Nobody likes him. Right now So you had, remember Lest in The Readies You remember who was Lest in The Readies He got fired, right You remember, right Remember Hes gone and now Neils taking his place. Neil is actually a nice guy, but he doesnt like Trump too much. And he put this woman on today and she said, Donald Trump didnt do well in the debates and he won, because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg, sometimes referred to as Mini Mike. And I said, Wait a minute, I won every debate. Its true. And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll. Not only won them, but won by a lot. I won every debate. Im just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, Time Magazine. I said, Nobodys allowed to do that. You cant do that. Were at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news. They make up 90% of the story. So where is Dan Scavino Where is Scavino Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is Dan, bring me those pages up here. Bring those pages up. See if you can get them. Go get them. Its such fake news. Its so disgusting. You know what Theyd do better if they told the truth. Do you agree Theyd do better. Oh, someday in 10, 14, 18, 22 years when Im gone, when we leave office in 26 years or so, theyre going to miss us. I told the story that a month before I ran, 2016 I was thinking about it. I said to my wife, who has become a great First Lady. People love here. They said its one of the greatest fields ever assembled. And I said, What the hell should I run for if they are so great But I remember holding up the New York Times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain, a supermarket, right Its like, the thing was blowing in the wind. It was dead and now its successful again. But when we leave, its all of us. We leave together. Were unified. This is the most unified the Republican party has ever been. And when we leave, the New York Times Thank you. The great Dan Scavino, the most powerful man in politics. Hey Dan. So Zuckerberg left. Who is number one in the world on Facebook And Im saying this in front of the fake news because if Im wrong, theyre going to report me, right Who is number one in the world on Facebook He walked in, but thats us. He walked in for We had dinner recently just because I want them to pay taxes. I want to find out whats going on. But he walked in, hes smart, and he said, I just want to congratulate you. Small dinner, a few people. He said, Youre number one in the world in Facebook. I said, Thats nice. I said, Whos number two He said, Prime minister Modi of India. I said, Wait a minute, wait a minute. Hes got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one. But were never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for Facebook, for Twitter, for anything, and they still havent figured it out. They have not figured it out. But look at all that press. Look at all that press. Did this ever happen before And then you have Brad Pitt. I was never a big fan of his. He got upset. A little wise guy statement. A little wise guy. Hes a little wise guy. Anyway, but were doing what Over here, I just showed this real quick. Right So this horrible journalist, shes a real, shes a Trump hater. You know what shes worth Zero ratings. Nobody watches her, but she said she was trying to Look, Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. He choked. Hes another one whos going,  Oh I cant breathe. I cant breathe. Dont ask me the question, please. I look at my wife, I said, Lets send him a little note. Its not so easy up there to do what I did, right Not so easy. But this woman who is a third rate, fourth rate, shes been with everybody. Every year shes with a different group, but I wont use her name because itll make her too famous. It actually plays to their advantage. But shes third rate and shes on the lowest rated show at Fox, Neil Cavuto. Thats why. So she said, Donald Trump didnt get good ratings. He didnt do well in the polls. She said, He didnt do well on the debates. She said that we were defeated in the debates. Well I defeated crooked Hillary every time and by a lot. Yeah, shes crooked as a 3 bill. I was going, Whatever happened to the 33,000 emails Whatever happened 33,000, she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didnt get in trouble. Can you imagine if a Republican did that They would want to bring back the death penalty, right Two standards. But I think things are happening. I said drain the swamp, I just never knew how deep it was. We have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe. And this is part of the swamp. So what happens She said, Donald Trump didnt do well in the debates. Now remember my answer, Rosie ODonnell, right First question Ive ever, and we took down the house. Then the second, Brett Barry asked me, I had to raise the hand. Im the only one, I guess that raised the hand. Right And the place went crazy because I was the only one telling the truth. Okay Turns out I was the only one telling And the people get it. But she said I didnt do well on the bench. I said, Really I won every single debate. We had 15 to 14 debates, then we had the presidential debates with crooked Hillary against myself. So heres one. I dont want to Im a little guilty because these are all my friends, right A lot of them are my friends now. They werent my friends then, they were my mortal enemy. Its hard to be friends when youre competing against somebody. Youre right about that. So heres Donald Trump, 67. The next one was 13%. the next one was 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%, 2%, 1%, 1%, and 0. All right, thats Time Magazine. All right, thats Time. They dont like me. I dont like them either, by the way. Although actually I do like the new owner. This year I got beaten out by Gretta. You know Gretta Last year I got beaten out I mean, Ive won it. But when the world evolves around all of us, we should be chosen. Theres nothing wrong with it, right I mean, weve won it, but we should win it every single year, lets face it. And now they call it person of the year. They dont go out man of the year. And I know the women out there are saying, Isnt that nice But a lot of the women out there dont like it. They dont like it. We could have a woman of the year and a man of the year. I like that. Okay, heres Drudge Report. Drudge is starting to treat me good again. He started to like me again. I like him. Look, Trump and Ted Cruz, I can say he came in second. He was a great debater. And Marco came in third and a guy who I dont like much and they dont like him much in Ohio either, Kasich. Kasich. He was way down. Way down. Okay, look who won Trump. Heres another one. Look again, a different one, Time Magazine. Trump, 33%. Ben Carson, good man, he was down. Marco, Jed, Ted. Carly Fiorina, a name I havent heard in a long time. What happened to Carly And ran, good poll. Heres the story. Look, but way up. Way up. Look at this. Heres another one. Look at this. Trump 46%. I didnt make this up. Heres another one. This is a different debate. I dont know. Theyre all different. I won every one of them. Look, Trump, I just took these at random, 46%. second, 5%, 3%, 5%, 3%, 9%, 5%, 11%. Trump, 46%. Heres another one, CNBC. Well, the markets been up. Theyve actually been not so bad and Joe Kiernan is a good guy. He is a good guy. Some of the rest, I dont care for it too much. Beckys like, she plays it a little bit down in the middle, right Which is okay. Trump, almost 50%. Then they have all the rest of them. 14, 4, 3, 2, 2.8, 2.54, 1.9, Im not going to give you the names. I wont tell you that I got 48.8 and Jeb Bush got 1.1. The rest Im not going to talk about, but he hasnt been exactly a great supporter, sort of a never Trumper I guess. So Jeb, 1.9, 1.1, and Trump 48. Thats another one. Oh, heres a nice one. Heres a nice one. Look at this. Look at this. Trump 70%, next one is 18%, next one is 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. Trump didnt do well in the debate. See, theyre fake news. Heres another one, Trump Kicked Ass. Trump Kicked Ass. Trump 48, number two was six. Heres another one. Trump 75.6, crooked Hillary was 24%. This was against crooked Hillary. So look at that. Trump was 74.6, crooked Hillary Clinton was 24.1. Trump was 80%, crooked Hillary was 18%. And Ive got this woman. You know who it is, right Nobody knows the name. Im not going to mention it. But everybody knows Neil Cavuto. She has no credibility and neither do you, Neil Cavuto. Heres another one. Crooked Hillary, and by the way, one is a Fox poll, one is Breitbart, one is a Drudge report. One is a Patch, one is Syracuse.com, one is Pollack Opinion, Alyssa Goodwin. But look at these numbers. Trump 92. What is it So Im winning every poll, I beat crooked Hillary. Heres the one, Trump 61, crooked Hillary 39. Okay Thats what it is. And then I turn on the damn show on Fox. Again, its not the same. It was much better. It really was. It was much better. I turn on Fox and Ive got this third rate political journalist, if you call her that saying, Trump did very poorly in the debates, but he became president. No, I did great in the debates. I became president because of the debates, because unlike Mini Mike, I could answer questions. And heres the final one and I could get you another 15. These are all the ones that taken right after. People call in, hundreds of thousands of people, they call in Time Magazine, CNBC. So heres a CNBC, crooked Hillary Clinton, 39%. Donald Trump, 61%. and then this stupid person said I didnt debate well. Now look, I dont mind and you can have bad debates, but I won every single debate. Listened to this, then three and a half, four years later I have to listen to a person saying how we didnt do well, because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world. Take it. Take it. Here it is. Okay, lets get back to business. Now I feel good. Now I feel good. Shes a third rate journalist. Lets go. Were standing up in defense of our constitution, our freedom and democracy itself, right While the extreme left has been wasting Americas time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes, we went through hoaxes. We went through the impeachment scam. And by the way, Corey was with us all the way. He didnt move. He didnt budge. He said its a lot of bull. He said its a lot of bull. But while theyre doing that stuff and were working with a cloud, were working with these people. They want to take you out. They want to change the results. They got caught spying, lets say it like it is, right They got caught spying on our election. Fake news. Hey fake news, take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you. Go ahead, show them the room. Show them the room. You see, they never do it, including Fox, by the way. Fox is not that much better. We just got lucky because we have some All their high rated shows are the shows that like Trump, all their losers shows like Cavuto are the shows that dont like Trump. How is Shep Smith doing lately, by the way How is Shep Smith He had the lowest ratings and now Cavuto took his place so thats okay. But they never show the room. My wife, a great First Lady, she goes I say, Hi honey. Did you watch the debate Yeah. How did the room look Was that because last night I think we turned away 21,000 people. We had an arena that it held 12, but we fill up the basketball courts, right Or the ice rink. We had to have 15, 16,000 people. It was on fire. You all saw it. It was great. And she said to me, she said, Darling, how did you do I said, I did great. I said, Did you see the arena And she said, No, they never show the arena. You know that guy Dana White at UFC I wont tell you about him yet, but hes a brilliant guy, right I mean, he sold his crazy fighters, I mean bomb bomb bomb. 4 billion he got with Fertittas, great people. But you know what Theyre always showing its full. Its full. These fakers back there, they dont want people. But Ill tell you what my wife said, They dont show it, but you cant imitate 15,000 people when it comes to the noise. Look, they wont show it. They never show it and weve never had an empty seat from the day I came down the escalator, not one. What these guys do if Mr. And Mrs. Jones sitting right up there, beautiful couple. If she said, Darling, Im sorry, theres nothing I can do about it, darling. I have to go to the bathroom. He said, Darling, Ill walk with you. The cameras glong on to those seats, they glong on and they say, There were two empty seats. Trump didnt fill up the room. These are the worst people. But when I told them to spin around those cameras, they stayed that way. Now, if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena, it could be up in that corner where its loaded up with people, those cameras that can do, they look like a pretzel. They look like a pretzel. They want to find it. Theres trouble, those same guys could, it could cover anything. I used to think, well its the equipment, its very rigid. They cant turn it. And then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because thats dangerous in this room, to be honest. We dont have it too much. They only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and arent fighters. But if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around, spin around like a pretzel. They bend, boom, they get. So that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment. And by the way, I told them, turn around, not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because its fake news. While the extreme left has been wasting Americas time with vial hoaxes, weve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, right We added another 225,000 brand new beautiful jobs last month, way, way, way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be, 225,000. Think of it, we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country, almost 160 billion. 00 in the morning, they are watching. The whole world was watching. That was the most exciting television that anybodys ever seen. Even ESPN, some guy on ESPN said, This is the most exciting event Ive ever seen. And all he does is watch sporting events and big ones. But since the election, 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and weve invested more than 2 trillion into that military that we talked about. And we created- Into that military that we talked about, and we created something thats very exciting. And we have our great new General. Hes on the  hes on our  Ill tell you, he was on a list of the most incredible men youve ever seen. The sixth branch of the United States Armed forces, the Space Force. And I will be making a big decision for the Space Force as to where its going to be located, and I know you want it. Well be making that decision toward the end of the year. I was here, I did your  I met  I was up at the Air Force Academy, and I greeted those kids, they were so great. I did the commencement address. Was anybody there I did the commencement address. And the General said, sir, would you like to shake hands with the cadets I said, does everyone else do it, President Oh, yes, sir. What he didnt say is, theyll shake 10 hands. I said, so they do  how many do you have Sir, we have 1156 cadets. I said, you mean other people do it Yes, sir. But they dont do 1156. Theyll do 30, 40. Theyll take the top 10 out of the class. I said, Ill do it. I stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing. True. And I shook 1156 hands. And a lot of these kids are very strong physically. In fact, you have one of them as an example, he was the winner of the home run derby. Did you know that College  think of that. The college home run derby. I said, let me see you. I want to see what you look like. He stands up, uniform, everything else. And by the way, I did something for Air Force, but I did something for all of the academies. If you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting, although theyve done well, if youre a great athlete, you cant  we wanted to get them to go, but they didnt because they didnt want to serve five years in the military and then theyd go into the NFL or baseball. So, I had one of the teams in. They said, sir, give us the waiver, sir. Theyve been after the waiver. You know what the waiver is That means that if youre a great athlete, you can go to the Air Force Academy, or Army, Navy, the Coast Guard, you can go to one of our service academies. I did the rule and we got it through Congress. And you dont have to serve. You go directly into the major leagues and to the NFL, and you serve your time after, when you get out. Isnt that great And the Army coach, whos a great guy  all great guys. Navy coach, Army coach, said sir, if you do that, we can compete with anybody, because we lost lot of great athletes who said, you know, we just cant do that. Now they serve their time afterwards. Isnt that great And we did it. Theyve been trying to get that for so many years. But I love that group of people. I saw this guy from the home run derby, and I shook hands. Oh, I shook hands. And they come up and theyre strong people. And theyre shaking, and theyre excited. Theyre a little nervous, maybe. Theyre meeting the President. Theyre a little nervous, and theyre strong. Theyve got big, strong hands, and theyre saying  and Im saying, hello. Sir, thank you. Man. Jeez. What are you Im captain of my wrestling team, sir. I admire you greatly, sir, thank you, sir. Its like  and Im trying to act like it doesnt hurt. By the end of the day, Im going like  but we did it. And then I said, wait a minute. I said, General, no other President could do that. The Presidents dont do that. He said, no, they do, sir, but they stop, usually, at around 50. Oh, thats great. But I love the Air Force Academy. And you have all of the infrastructure, so youre being very strongly considered for the Space Command. Very strongly. And actually, I have to say this. I think I can say this, Mr. Senator, but the Governor showed up at the plane today, your Governor. Democrat. No, but in all fairness, he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it. Thats okay, thats all right. And we are going to be making that decision, Cory, when we make that decision, all right Okay. But weve destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate 100 percent. We killed the founded and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. Hes dead. Hes dead. And we just killed the worlds number one terrorist, Qasen Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. Forever and ever. He was the king of the roadside bomb, right When you see these young men and in some cases women, no legs, no arms. They get it, and 92 percent of them were from Soleimani, and then they started making them  they had great detection. We had these guys, great detection, then all of a sudden, the detection wasnt working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal. So theyre blowing the guys up with the scopes, so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic. Real scum, but hes gone, hes evil, hes dead, and America is respected again like never before. But as we keep on winning, Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. Theyve gone nuts. Thats why millions of registered Democrats, voters, people that were with the Democrats for a long time, theyre leaving their party to join our movement. Theyre joining our great Republican party. We have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years. And dont believe stories, and dont believe polls, because the polls are worse than the stories. They give phony polls. 00. The polls have closed  and you know they only announce if youre very  if youre really going to win by a lot. Otherwise, it takes all night. The polls have closed in the great state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas. Thank you. But they had Alfred E. Newman, Buttigieg, little Buttigieg. I said, Ive had you up to here. They had little Buttigieg leading Donald Trump in Texas. These people. But very close. They said, its too close to call, where Buttigieg  so, a friend of mine from Texas, a big, powerful, strong guy, real Texas, hes got the cowboy hat  Id love to wear that hat, I wouldnt have to comb my hair so much. I wouldnt need hairspray, right I love those Texas hats. I dont know if wed get away with it in Washington, thats my only problem, but I love them. This guy wears that big hat, the biggest hat. Hes a big guy. And hes interviewed by somebody. He said, listen, I dont know much about politics, but I can tell you one thing. Buttigieg is not tied with the President. The President is leading him by 20 points. Its like I said the last time, nobodys leading Trump in Texas. And you know what Nobody is even close to us in the great state of Colorado. Were leading big. Nobody. With your energy and enthusiasm, this November, and specifically its November 3rd is the big day, and this is going to be as big  and I cant say bigger, because what was bigger than that They came from the hills, they came from the mountains, they came out of the rivers, they came all over the place. Great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. Women would come in, they hadnt voted in 20 years, great women, beautiful women, strong women, smart women, wives. No, no, incredible. And they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and theyre  were the elite, just so you  theyre not the elite, were the elite. And you know what Theyd show up, theyve got Trump bandanas along with our great Vice President Mike Pence, Trump Pence, and they got the hats now and they walk  these are people that were never political people. They never wore a pin. Now theyve got 30 pins all over their chest, theyve got the hats with the things and the Trump, and nobodys ever seen anything like it. Really, its a great revolution, and were turning this country around. And Im not saying anything can ever compete with 2016, but I think if we dont do it, a lot of what weve done, and were going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what weve done for the vets with choice and accountability, but you know what They can undo it, but in four years they cant undo it, because that tree will be planted. It will be solid. Theyre not going to be able to do it, so weve got to win. And your second amendment is at stake, remember that. So this November, were going to take back the House, were going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So were thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country, and I want to thank Mike Pence. I heard he gave a great speech. I never want it to be too good. I never want it to be too good. I said, Mike, take it easy. Cant be too got. Mike is great. But we have Secretary David Bernhardt, Department of Interior. Thank you. Come on up, Dave. Hes great. What hes doing, by the way, hes the largest landlord by a factor of about 2000. Department of the Interior. Youre taking good care of Colorado, please Okay. Hes a big deal in Colorado, right Hes a big deal. All those beautiful mountains and rivers and lakes, hes the guy. You better keep them nice and clean. Believe me, we like the environment more than anybody. We want clean water and we want clean air. And you have warriors. You have guys, they fought for us. 197 to nothing. We were  when you think of it, the Republicans, 197 on the house to nothing. Congressman Ken Buck, come on up. Congressman Scott Tipton. And Congressman Doug Lamborn. Thank you, Doug. Thank you. And were also joined tonight by somebody that you really love, and I love him, too, but theres a reason. Hes my son. Don junior. And Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly, thank you, Kimberly. And a man  he happens to own the Chicago Cubs, but thats okay. Hes done an incredible job, actually. He had a five year plan on the fifth year, the stadium was fully rebuilt, and they won the World Series. Thats not bad. He had a five year plan. RNC finance chairman Todd Ricketts. Come on up, Todd. Come on up. Come on up, Todd. And I mentioned him a little earlier, but you didnt know he was here. I just said hes a champion, hes a winner. Hes been a friend of mine for a long time. Hes a tough cookie. Hes the kind of people that made our country great. Truly, theyve made our country great. He started off with two people fighting each other, then he got four people fighting each other, then he got them fighting each other, each other. Then he got six and eight and 12. All of a sudden people started watching and looking, and I was proud to hold his first event. Thats why he loves me. They didnt want  they said, its too dangerous. Nobody would take it. Im the only who said, take it. Well take it. And it was unbelievable. I went and I said, this is great. Lets do it again. And he has been my friend for a long time. And they put together a phenomenal deal, its called UFC. Hes the UFC president. And they just sold the company. He started it off for about  30, and they just sold it for 4 billion. And the people that bought it said, were not buying it unless Dana White stays back and runs it. So Dana White, come on up. Hes now a very wealthy guy. Come here. You want to hear from him Yes. Whats up, Colorado How are you today So, Im not a very political person, Ill start there, but let me say this. Theres things that I can tell you about the President of the United States that you dont hear on t.v. and you dont hear from other people. Like you said, Ive known this man for 20 years. Weve actually become even closer since hes become the President of the United States. When somebody becomes the President of the United States, you dont ever expect to hear from them again, and I understand it. It absolutely makes sense. This guy is so loyal and such a good friend, every time I see him  I saw him today. When I met him on Air Force One, the first thing he said to me is, how is your family How is your family Good man, very loyal, and a very good friend. I see a lot of things from Mr. Trump that the public doesnt see, and the people who surround me every day see how this man treats me as a friend, and other people hes friends with. Hes a fighter, he loves this country, hes doing great things for this country, and we got to win this election again, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. That was beautiful, because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time. Right, politicians What a job he does, and we thank you very much, Dana, and you are my great friend, and thank you. But with Cory and with me, theyre not going to play with your second amendment. Not going to happen, but its  it is under siege. You see whats happening. But somebody  we fight together, and hes been so great. Cory Gardner, please come on up, please. Thank you. Thats beautiful. Thats true of the pipeline. A long time theyve been trying. We got it right away, and well be announcing something very big toward the end of the year. Cory is a champion for the people of Colorado. He loves your state. Look, he loves your state. He was here, he does the tractor thing. He loves tractors, he sells a certain type. And dont worry, if theres any noise, just let them  they wont hear us. And hes got my complete and total support and endorsement. He will never let you down. The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded. And for women, 71 years, and soon youre going to be hitting the historic number. 71 years, the best numbers in 71 years. African-American and Hispanic-American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women is going  and Im telling you, within a very short period of time, youre going to see some statistics coming out on  statistics. Ive got to do it right, otherwise theyll say, whats wrong If you go 16 of these, and if you mispronounce one word, they say, whats wrong Statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable. Theyre going to be unbelievable. The best ever. The veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded in U.S. history. Half a million more Hispanic-Americans now own a home. Weve lifted 10 million people off of welfare, and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country. Think of that. Think of this. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with Tim Scott great guy, great Senator from South Carolina, opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in Colorado. You know about that, right Its been amazing. Opportunity zones are amazing, whats happened. Were supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it, reducing the cost of child care, and giving 40 million American families an average of 2,200 in their pockets directly thanks to the Republican child tax credit. People dont know that. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of Washington bureaucrats. We repealed the ridiculous waters of the United States rule, which was basically taking away your property. And we are taking the Bureau of Land Management out of Washington, DC. Were just on it, and thank you very much Secretary Bernhardt. Just up here, nice, slim, beautiful looking man. He looks beautiful. When you work with him hes beautiful because he gets it done, and youre moving it and its headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great American west should live right here in the great American west. And we have ended the war on American energy. It was a war, and were up here and were doing it. We are right now energy independent, can you believe it They want to use wind, wind, wind. Blow wind, please. Please blow. Please keep the birds away from those windmills, please. Tell those beautiful bald eagles, oh, a bald eagle. You know, if you shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for a long time, but the windmills knock them out like crazy. Its true. And I think they have a rule, after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year. Do you believe this Do you believe this And theyre all made in China and in Germany. Siemans. And for those of you that want to hear it, when theyre making them, more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone, the atmosphere. More stuff is going up there, theyre making it, ay, ay, ay. And they dont say this, but after a period of time they get tired, they get old, they get rusty, and a lot of the guys say, hey, their useful life is gone. Lets get the hell out of here, and theyre all over the place. You look at Palm Springs, California. Take a look. Palm Springs, theyre all over the place. Theyre closed, theyre rotting, they look like hell. Every major Democrat running for President wants to entirely eliminate American production of oil and natural gas, crushing Colorados economy, destroying tens of thousands of Colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state. Theyre doing that. Look, youre going to vote for one of these people, probably crazy Bernie. He seems to be leading. Mini Mike, I thought he might come up, but he cant because he cant debate. He wasnt meant for the camera, do we agree He wasnt exactly great last night. No, I think he lost too last night. Only in Colorado could somebody say that. No, youre going to probably  it looks like Bernie, doesnt it It looks like crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernies not big into natural gas and oil, and the things that keep our great factories and plants going. But Colorado voters will never let it happen. Were reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and Chinas entrance into the WTO. But under this administration, all of that is changing. The era of economic surrender is over, thank you. Its over. Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada agreement into law. Incredible deal. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Colorado and every other state. Also, something we got that people dont talk about, if you love your children, you dont have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses. If you love your children, its great, and if you dont love your children, dont worry about it. Who in the hell knows. If you dont love them, dont leave that beautiful farm to your children. Give it to somebody else, okay If they dont treat you well, give dont leave them a damn thing. Are you listening, Donnie Are you listening, Donnie I also took  no, it is true. Thats a big deal. Farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their  people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth. You couldnt do it. Theyd go out  your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money. Theyd end up losing their business, losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years. You know what happens. And theyre good kids, and maybe theyll never be you. They cant farm like you and maybe they cant any maybe they can, maybe theyre better. But you know what Theyd go out and theyd borrow a lot of money and theyd lose the farm. The numbers are staggering. We got rid of it. No more death tax, no more inheritance tax. And I also took the strongest ever action to confront Chinas massive theft of American jobs. What theyve done to us over the years, we were losing 200 billion, 300, 400, 500, not million, billion. Billion. Not million. 500 million would be a lot. Were talking about 500 billion, they were taking it. Our strategy worked. We put tariffs up, 25 percent on the first 250 billion. Billions of dollars poured into the United States. They devalued their currency and they pumped money in. We didnt pay for it despite the fact that these guys  they like to say they did, we didnt pay for it, and Ill tell you what. China- They like to say they did. We didnt pay for it. Ill tell you what, China came to the table, and we made a deal thats great for us and hopefully its great for them. Last month, as you know, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports 250 billion worth of purchases, 50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase, 50 billion. You know the most they ever purchased were 16 billion. You know that story. Ive told it a couple of times. 16 billion was the most ever. Secretary Sonny Purdue agriculture, hes done a great job. I said, Whos the most Whats the biggest year 16 billion, sir. I said, All right, make it 20. So they agreed on 20 so now were getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made. Were getting ready to close the deal between that and USMCA. Were getting ready to close it. I go over, I say, What do you have down for the farmers Theyve been great, although I have been helping you out. I gave you a lot of money. I gave you a lot of money. 16 billion on year, 12 billion from the year before. I took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it. But I said, So tell me fellas, let me ask you, what do we have Whats the number  20 billion, sir. Theyre going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products. I said, Make it 50. Tell them to make it 50. So, we went to China and they were great. You know they got 1.5 billion people. You got a lot of feeding to do. I said, Do me a favor, instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers, would you make it 50 No, no, no, no, no, and they agreed to do it. They agreed to it. I dont think youre going to be able to make it. You better be able to make it. I dont want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, Im sorry we cant produce that much, sir. I said, Our farmers will find a way. Theyll go out and buy larger tractors and theyll buy some extra land. Go out and buy a bigger tractor or something. No, but it is true. Ive had people say, Sir, they cant produce that much. I said, Forget it. They will. Look at them. Youre a farmer. Theyll figure that one out. Although Mike Bloomberg said youll never figure it out. Theyll figure it out long before him. Youll figure that one out long before him. No, I know the farmers. Im not worried about it. 50 billion on no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration. Every day Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives. This region alone, last year ICE officers arrested over 2000, and by the way, our ICE officers, these guys are tough and theyre brave. Over 2000 criminal aliens, thats MS-13 gangs, thousands, and they bring them back to where they came from. By the way, now their countries take them back. They werent taking them back, safe third agreements. They take them back. Charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. We bring them back and in some cases we dont even want to bring them back. We have to put them. I dont want to house them for the next 50 years, but you know what We dont want to take chances either, but well bring them back to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. We bring them back. They didnt use to take them. They said, We dont want them back. Oh, okay, well keep them ourselves. We dont do that anymore. In Denver, an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times, attempting to murder him his own home. The alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years. Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country. In communities across the nation, radical, and were watching them very closely, left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and sanctuary states, and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities. Last year, Colorado Democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals. As a result of state and local sanctuary policies, officials in Boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community. In Denver, officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges, and now he is a very dangerous man. We just caught him for attempted murder. Right here in Colorado Springs, El Paso County officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery, assault, and kidnapping. They released him straight into your community. These are the Democrats. These are your Democrats. Democrats think that Colorado should be a haven for murderers, predators, kidnappers, and felons in our country and that come in illegally. Republicans believe that Colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote for Cory, vote for Trump, vote for the Republican party. Were getting it done. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, weve reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release. You know what you do You catch him. You say, Where do you live They dont live here. They dont have an address. Where do you live Give us your address. They dont have an address. Many are criminals. Many are very dangerous criminals. So theyre saying, and we are building the wall. Its gone up 122 miles as of yesterday. Its a serious wall. Did you hear Two weeks ago, a small section, twice the size of this stage, we were putting it up and theyre pouring the concrete, and a lot of, its Mexico, its very rough territory, some of it. Its partially desert. We were in a rough area, very windy, and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm. So we hadnt put it in. We put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said Trumps wall fell down. It was blown down. But see, at least we have a voice where we can explain. Its true. We lifted it up and we held it up. When the storm went by, we had it set and its set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years. Can you imagine I said what happened in a certain area, and were doing a great job by the way, in New Mexico. New Mexico is going to be a great, great state for the Republican party, and Arizona, what were doing on the border in Arizona, they want us to do it badly. But can you imagine that A thing falls over because the concrete was just poured, its soaking wet and it falls over, and they make it sound like the wall fell down. These are very, very dishonest people, but you know that. Border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded. Its horrible whats happening, the largest amount ever recorded. Weve deported record numbers of gang members, especially the MS-13 gang members, but there are others that are just as bad. Weve done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country. The border is going to be very soon secured. Well have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernies healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their great private coverage that you want. While the Socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare, and trying to destroy your social security, that wont happen with me, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great, great healthcare, already done a good job. Were defending your right to keep the doctor, and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember, President Obama 28 times, he said, Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Right It was a lie. We should impeach him. We should impeach him. Impeach Obama. Get him out of office. No, nobody thought of that. We caught him in a lie 28 times at least. Hes on record. We caught him in a lie, but nobody said lets impeach him. Only these maniacs, crazy Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer. What about the little pencil neck, right Pencil neck. Hes got the worlds smallest neck. Heres a guy that lied about my statement. He made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract. He made up a statement. It was totally fiction. He made it up and then they tell me, youre getting ready to sue him, and they say, Oh no, hes protected because he made the statement in the halls of Congress. That should be worse. No, that should worse. Little wise guy. Were making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office. Were now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and theyre better. Theyre better. Were protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will. Were fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency. Thats going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way. Watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. We have totally transform veterans health care, including getting the long sought VA choice and VA accountability. So, now if our veterans have to wait in line, they go out to a doctor, a local doctor, we pay the bill and theyre all set. They dont have to wait for six weeks. Hes agreeing, right Good. Right You dont see those stories. You used to see all these horrible vet stores, veterans, the veterans on television, and you dont see it because veterans choice, its amazing. Our great veterans, heres a man right here. Youre saying, yes. Purple Heart. Thank you. Thank you. Thats great. But its a lot different under Trump, isnt it A lot different under Trump, and now you go out to a private doctor, but you know, we also got accountability. Theyve been trying to get these things done for 45, 46, 48 years, couldnt get them done. Im good at getting things approved. I have to say. But, we also got accountability where we can fire people that arent taking care of our vets. If somebody isnt doing a good job, you couldnt fire him. Now you look at him, you say, Get the hell out of here. Youre fired. We passed another thing. For 44 years, theyve been trying to get it passed, the spectacular Right to Try, where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick, we can use it and we are having tremendous results, Right to Try. I hope that nobody in this room needs it. I hope you dont need it, but if you do, we have the best in the world, and were seeing amazing results. Were combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for Americas youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. All of the radical Democrats in the Presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb, right up until the very moment of birth. You know that. That is why at my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. Thats what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. People forget that. People forget Honest Abe. Hes the most presidential guy. Ive always said I could be more presidential than anybody, but Im not sure I can beat Honest Abe when he wears the hat. That hat is too much. Its so easy to be presidential, so easy. Its so much easier than doing what I have to do, but you know what Id have Id have about three people in the front row. How about sleepy Joe How about his performance What What Its great to be with the great people of Ohio. Joe, Joe, youre in Iowa. Youre an Iowa. Oh, wow. He did it five times. So far, Ive never done it. Thank you. Ive never done it. If I do it, thats a bad sign. Now he does it all the time. He was in New Hampshire and he said he was in Vermont. Its great to be in Vermont. Joe, youre in New Hampshire. Dammit. Hed go up and tell him again and again. Joe, what the hell is wrong with you, Joe Sleepy Joe. Hes sleepy Joe. He was sleepy a long time ago, but now hes really sleeping. But its easy to be presidential. You know that. The easiest thing you could do is presidential. Never open your jacket. Never. Its got to be buttoned up. Right Ladies and gentleman, the President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Its so great to be with the people of Colorado. Thank you, everybody. Good night. Good night. No, no. Its so easy. Its so easy, honestly. Look, I did very well with the State of the Union, right They said it was one of the best. Smart, smart. Smart guy. We do good. Were representing you. I better do good. If I didnt do good, youd dump me so fast. Actually, I dont think you would dump be so fast, actually. You want to know the thing She said, were never dumping you. Fake news CNN went up to a woman. What does it take for you to leave the President Im not leaving him. There were 10 women, and the one woman, beautiful, incredible women, and they had their bandanas, they had hats, Trump, and stupid CNN, they go up, What does it take for you Then he goes, Look, he said one time that his people are so good, theyd stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue. Do you remember Right  Would you stay if he shot somebody This is actually an answer, or something to the effect, Would you say every shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue The woman looks, Well, it depends why he shot him. Makes sense. Depends why he shot him. But then they said, Were not leaving him. Were never leaving him. Were in thing together, folks. We got the swamp. We got that dirty, rotten swamp. We got crooked politicians. We got a lot of bad people, but were getting them out one by one. We better be, little Adam Schiff, that little Adam Schiff. What a crooked politician. Hes a corrupt politician. Talking about guys, hell lie and then the next day get caught. Hell be sorry that he got caught. The next day hell walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing. Hes got no shame. Hes got no shame. Hes a liar. I think hes a sick person. Republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. You know that were the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We have the big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice, big deal, its a big deal, because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. To uphold the new rule of law, we have confirmed 217 brand new, beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. Thats a record. That is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime. So, think of it. If theyre 40 years old, if theyre 45 years old, they can be there for 40, 50 years. As you know, and by the way, thats a record by a lot. I have the record, but theres one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record. Who has the percentage Do you know George Washington, 100%. But it was only 16 people. So, with 217, can you imagine that Its a record and were going up. Were going up. The Democrats are thrilled about that one, and as you know, I have nominated and we have confirmed two great new Supreme court justices, Colorado zone, right Colorado. Thats right. Colorado zone, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Neil Gorsuch, thats right. Colorado. Hes a great guy, too, great guy. Colorado. Thats a big thing. Thats another great check you have down for count. Neil Gorsuch. I recognized Israels true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. They said they were going to do it for years. We recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our investments in the United States military include more than 300 million this year. Has anyone ever heard of a place called Fort Carson Another place, Peterson Air Force Base, you know that. Another place, the Air Force Academy, you know that, and Schriever, right, Air Force Base Schriever. Schriever. Was that right Schriever, right Schriever, thats a little tricky one. It took me a little while. Im looking at that sucker. Im saying, Schriever, right. Thank you. Thats very nice. He saw he was having a little trouble with that one. Thats tricky. You dont like to mispronounce a word. You come to a great place like this and instead of calling it Fort Carson, you go at Fort crasson, and they say, Oh, this guy doesnt know anything about us. No, a lot of money going into Fort Carson. Its great. For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. You saw that. Well, Id like to apologize. We dont apologize. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Colorado. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020, November 3rd. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. Well get it finished. Well get it finished. Theyre bad people. Theyre all over the place. Theyre bad people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. You know that. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact great new trade deals like weve been doing. Im going to India next week and were talking trade. Theyve been hitting us very hard for many, many years, but I really like Prime Minister Modi. We got to talk a little. Weve got to talk a little business. Theyve been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs. One of the highest in the world is India. But I hear theyre going to have 10 million people, they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful. But you know what, and the only problem with doing that, Prime Minister Modi said, We will have 10 million people greet you. Heres my problem. We have a packed house. We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldnt get in. Its going to look like peanuts from now on. Ill never be satisfied with the crowd. If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied if we fill up a 60,000 seat stadium Big deal. See, Im getting spoiled. He said, Build a bigger stadium. Thats good. Colorado, very good. But its going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. That beautiful phrase. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer. Theyve made such progress, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. We started a year ago. It should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then. They didnt start it, but were starting it. Well have it done within nine years. Its a 10 year process. Think of that. AIDS. we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first station in the world to plant our flag on Mars. You have a lot of that action happening right here. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Thats a big one. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one, beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, from Pueblo to Fort Collins, from Denver to Durango, from Black Forest to Broomfield, from Castle Rock to right here in Colorado Springs, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, and sweat, and soul, to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. Colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors, cowboys and miners, and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, explored the west, scaled the Rockies, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth, and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. Americas thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Colorado, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you people of Colorado."
Pittsburgh,Sep22,2020,"Doesnt have the power. Doesnt have the staying power. You see whats happening in California. Blackouts, rolling blackouts. How would you like that in Pennsylvania The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Darling, whats wrong I cant watch Trump on television. I cant watch our president. Darling, we have a rolling blackout. Itll only be a few hours. I think well be on by two oclock in the morning, darling, and we can watch a rerun. Now, this is whats happening. You have rolling blackouts. You have, in some cases, just blackouts. I dont even call them rolling. Not going to happen to your state. Last year, I visited the Shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, the largest investment in your states history. That was all made possible by our pro energy policies. Weve done it a lot. In Louisiana, were building some of the largest plants youve ever seen, largest in the world and its incredible, all related to energy, but your security and your jobs are in very grave peril, because the radical left maniacs, they dont want to have anything to do with energy. They dont want anything to do with, they have different concepts, right They have the green new deal, whether it will be no energy, almost of any kind. No, its crazy. Thought of by AOC plus three. You know AOC and shes got them. Shes radical left, but shes not as bad as some of them. How about Omar of Minnesota Were going to win the state of Minnesota because of her, they say. Hes telling us how to run our country. How did you do where you came from How is your country doing Shes going to tell us, shes telling us how to run our country. You know what The Democrats in Congress, you have to see what they are doing. Their stance on Israel, its like a whole different world. Its like from 10 years ago, its like a different world and we want to keep our world the way it was and the way its going to be. Weve got the greatest country on earth and were going to keep it that way. We dont need socialist and we dont need communist telling us how to run our country. I do this every night and a lot of times its a waste. I did it last night. We were  Did you see the crowd we had last night We were in a great place, Ohio. We had a crowd. We had a crowd. You couldnt see the end of it. I said, Turn around camera, turn around. But, they never liked doing that, you know They dont like spinning those cameras. They dont want to show the crowd. They dont like showing. They dont like showing, show the crowd and this is  its an honor. Let me tell you. Look, I used to think that was a difficulty like it was a new camera that cant turn, but then whenever there was like a problem, like thered be a little argument or some kind of an anti-Trump person, you dont see that much. I dont want to bring it on, but you dont see it much anymore. You know why Its dangerous. Its dangerous for them, but you know, Id see the camera would never move, whenever where theres something like a little negative happening, that thing would turn around like a pretzel. I said, Oh, it does move. But, they never want to show the crowds. They never, last night. Now, I went home and I tell you this, I go home all the time. First lady, Howd you like the crowd Sir, I didnt see it. I didnt see it, but I didnt see it, Donald. I didnt see it. Sometimes shell call me Mr. President, but shes only kidding. Believe me. Shes only kidding. Has she been a great first lady, right Shes been a great first lady and very popular. Shes really done a great job. She works hard. We have some great people here tonight. I brought certain members of my family, but Im going to introduce them to you in a little bit, okay Great family. They work hard. Ill tell you what, they work hard. They really work hard. But I do wish they would show because it would be, you know, its actually better for them if they show. It shows the importance. The only thing you can do is show. Ill say, How did it look I dont know how it looked, but the sound was phenomenal. Okay It sounded like a Penn state football game like the Steelers football game. You cant disguise it. You ever see Sleepy Joe with the little circles Oh, you can. He puts them very far away, so far away. Then he comes up with the mask. Hes like a hundred yards from the nearest human being. Hes got a  He feels good about the mask. I wonder in the debate itll be him and I or the stage. Is he going to walk in with a mask No, I think hell come in with a mask. I dont know. I have no idea. Well, the question is, will he leave it on during the debate Because its a little hard and Im all for mask when you need them, Im up, but when youre making a speech and the nearest persons like where you are and youre in a stage all by yourself and then he had a habit of taking it off and it hangs down on his ear as hes speaking, it makes him feel comfortable. Honestly, whatever makes you feel good is okay with me, but itll be interesting. Im going to be, were going to have a big rating on that. Hes been doing it all his life. Hes been doing it for 47 years and Ive just started doing this stuff. Im just starting. But, Im just thinking, but I did it more in 47 months than he did in 47 years. Thats true. Thats true. You look at what weve done. No, its true. Thats actually true. He did a lot of negative stuff too. You have to deduct that out. When asked if there would be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking in a Biden administration, Joe replied, No, we would make sure that its all eliminated. All of a sudden, he gets the nomination. Hes been trying to get the nomination for decades. He finally get, and that was prime time for him, which was never great. He never got more than 1%. We called it. Remember, I called him his first nickname was 1% Joe. Frankly, had Elizabeth Warren been loyal to her philosophy, which is radical left, socialism, perhaps communism. I dont know, perhaps. Its verging on communism, right But had she been loyal, she wouldve left. She would have quit. She had no chance. She was out. Pocahontas. She was gone. Remember, I said,  I have more Indian blood in me than you have and I have none. Id love to have some, but I dont happen to have any. Then she choked and she went out and got a test. She announced she had 1024th, right 1,000. That means, like I said it last night, that means around 700 or 800 years ago, somewhere, there was a little bit of a relationship going and thats okay. Seven, 800 years ago, maybe. What a phony she is. Its terrible. Now, were going to pick a great woman, any one of the five that I told you, but any one of the women that we had theyre all great people, great scholars, great, brilliant people. A lot of people. 00 on Saturday at the White House. You see, we have tremendous Republican support. Two people. Always got to be two. Always got to be the two. Those two. We have great support from the Republican party, tremendous support. Its never been this unified before ever, ever and the fake impeachment. We had 196 to nothing Republican support. We had 52 and a half to a half in the Senate. Who is the half I cant imagine. I cant. Buddy was very good today. I have to tell you, he was good. Now, Im happy. Thank you, Mitt. Thank you. No, he was very good, very positive statement, but days ago, Biden reiterated his pledge to require net zero carbon emissions. Thats basically saying, you know what that is Therell be no more oil. Therell be no more gas. Therell be no more nothing. Therell be no more industry. Therell be no more country. Thats what its like really. That would instantly shut down all fracking and all mining immediately in Pennsylvania sending your jobs overseas, sending your money to somebody else, not you. Ill keep your jobs in Pennsylvania where they belong and youre going to be doing fracking for a long time. I can say the same because you are really big in energy. I can say the same thing to you as I say in Texas. So, they dont want oil. They dont want fracking, right They dont want the energy that we know that powers these massive plants because the other stuff is wonderful. Its not going to do it. Its not going to do it. So, they dont like oil. They dont like the gas. They dont like God, religion, churches are close. How about these states They still have churches closed. By the way, your governor hasnt been so great. You know that, right Are your churches still closed Theyre still closed. Theyre doing it for a reason. By the way, November 4th, theyll announce, Weve decided to open up. Okay Theyre trying to make our numbers as bad as possible. So, Californias closed. Pennsylvanias closed. North Carolinas closed. Michigan is closed. Thats another beauty right there, Michigans closed. Then they have these fake ballots, millions and millions of ballots. By the way, when not if, when you see shenanigans, please report it to your authorities. Okay The real authorities, theyre watching and the authorities are watching, but please report it. But when you look at it, really, its amazing. Theyre trying to make our numbers look bad, but even with numerous closed states and you notice also law and order, right Law and order, the red states, the Republican states, theyre working great. Record low crime, record low, but Democrat run states, you look at Chicago, you look at New York, New York has gone through a  We have to bring back. We should draft Rudy Giuliani. Okay Lets bring him back. Draft Rudy. We want Rudy. Rudy, Rudy. Ill tell you Rudy is amazing, but he did a great job. New York was in big trouble. He came in and he just was tough, smart, and it became the safest big city. Now, we have a man where some categories of crime were up 300%. He fired 1,000. He fired a lot of police, I guess, a billion dollars a year worth of police, worth of great police, firemen and women. Its a terrible thing. I love that place so much and its so sad to see whats happening to New York. Were going to make a little bit of a play for New York. In theory, the Democrats automatically win New York, but I do phenomenally in most parts. Then one part, its automatic, but I cant imagine that particular part is going to be very happy. So, were going to make a play for New York. With Pennsylvania, I dont have to make a play. Weve got Pennsylvania. Just go out of here. We dont have to make a play. We dont have to. Its a great, you know, for years though Pennsylvania was a place that Republicans just didnt win. For many years, everybody thought they were going to win, every Republican. So yeah, were going to win Pennsylvania. They thought they were going to win it and they didnt. I came along and we won it and we won it quite easily. Quite easy. I think were going to do even better now, because remember, number one in the history of your state last year, and thats because of what we did, we stopped the dumping. We saved your stell. So many different things, but Pennsylvania is the home of American energy. Think of it that way. This has taken place over a very short period of time. Also, the birthplace of a thing called the American constitution. Right American constitution. To uphold our constitution as written as opposed to as conceived by some radical left judge, I will soon be announcing that nominee. Youre going to love it. Youre going to be so happy. If you dont love it, dont vote for me. Okay You dont like it. My opponent refuses to release a list of justices. I was told that a big thing when I was running last time, nobody really knew me. They knew me very well. We had great success at The Apprentice and in business and it was great, but they never knew what kind of a judge I would pick or to be a justice, right A justice of the Supreme Court. I said, I mean, what am I going to do How am I going to solve that problem But, I was in politics, never. Dont forget, when I ran, they said, No, hes inexperienced. I ran against some very talented people. Some of whom are very good friends of mine. Some of whom I dont like too much. When I dont like somebody, it last for a long time, but I said, Well, how do we solve that problem I dont know. They just werent believing. The appointment of a- Just werent believing. The appointment of a United States Supreme Court justice was much more important to the voters than I thought. And theyre right, because they will set policy for 50 years and theyll set policy, whether its life, whether its second amendment. The second amendment, if I werent president, you know the pressure, your second amendment would be obliterated. It would maybe be gone, but at a minimum obliterated, they havent touched your second amendment. Not even touched it. Because Im here to block. Im a blocking force. Im like a lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Im a blocking force. No, they havent touched it. But your second amendment would be under siege. So nobody knew. I never knew. You hear about Supreme Court, you know about Supreme Court, you know about other judges, by the way at the end of the first term, well be close to 300 federal judges, including court of appeals, which I think is a record. I guess its a record. Its a lot. Thats a lot. Nobodys done that. Its record. Think of that. 300. Thats a big percentage of the entire judiciary. Think of that. 300. And many, many court of appeals judges, but two great Supreme Court judges or justices. And now were going to get a third. Can you imagine our enemies Three in one term. So many presidents, they just dont have the chance and its so important. But I said to my people, I said, so if they dont believe me, what Ill do is Ill make up a list of 25 judges or people and well tell them, I will only pick from that list. They said, That sounds like an interesting idea. This was my idea. When youve never run for office before you have to have a little bit of imagination. So I got out a list, I named the people, the people are good, and I said, And I promise that I will pick someone like the people on this list. And it didnt work. It went nowhere because they didnt trust it. They said, We want you to pick the people on the list, not somebody like the people on the list. So I went back the next week, I said, I will pick somebody thats on this list. And they were all great, great judges for the most part, I think almost entirely, but judges and really respected conservative believers in our country, solid, incredible people. And as soon as I did that, things went through the roof. It was amazing how important it was. By the way, would you stand up with that beautiful jacket I love this guy. How many times- How many events Hes been to a couple. Thats really great. Thank you very much. Ive seen him before. Hes been here a couple of times, like about 90. Thank you, man. Thats really nice. Im going to get one of those jackets. By the way, the wall. The wall, yeah, 330 miles. 330 miles. 330 miles. And yes, we have a great relationship with Mexico. First they said, Hell never be able to build it. The Democrats were just brutal. I made a terrible mistake, I said it last night, I should have said, We will not under any circumstances build a wall at our Southern border. They would have given me all the money in the world. But stupidly, I said, We will build a wall. And the Democrats said, Lets not give it to him. But we got it, we won. We won court cases, we won court cases. I won so much money we could build four walls if we wanted. So then they said, All right, all right. Theyve lost. So by the way, were up to 330, the exact wall. Their dream choice. I said to the border patrol, I love these people, theyre great, ICE, the border patrol, what they do is incredible. Theyre incredible. I said, Give me your dream wall, as long as were building we might as well build a wall that you want. Lets build it right. Sir, we have to have vision. We need steel and concrete. I said, How about one or the other They said, No, sir, we need steel and concrete. We need steel. Inside those poles we have rebar and we have concrete and theyre 30 feet tall. We need all sorts of things. We need them to be wired. I wont tell you why theyre wired, but theyre wired for a reason. Theyre all wired up and theyre incredible. But you know what We got the wall. Nobody could have done it. So once we had the wall and it started going up and then we hit a hundred miles, 200 miles, now were at 330, and were building 10 miles a week and itll be finished very soon. And we have the most secure border in terms of drug trafficking, trafficking coming along and weve done phenomenally well. Because thats a lot of the territory that we need. Were going to go up to probably a little bit over 500 miles, so were at 330. But once they saw that I had it, they said, Yeah, but Mexicos not paying for it. But they are paying for it, Mexicos paying for the wall. They are paying for it. Theyre paying at the border. Theyre paying for the wall. All those trucks that go back and forth. Theyre paying for the wall. So the Democrats said, Yeah, but Mexico, they always have to find something, right And do you remember what I used to say that if they fight us, remember people would say, What happens if they fight you on the wall What happens if they fight you right to hell on the wall I said, The wall would get 10 feet taller. Took a little hit on that, we took a little bit of a hit, but thats okay. The wall is a tall sucker, you dont want to get up to the top. They look down, they say, Oh, ye, ye, how do we get down off this Its tall and its strong and its great. And we appreciate, because Mexico has been working with us very closely. They have right now 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border making sure that people dont come into our country. I want to thank the president of Mexico. Very helpful. So I made this list of potential justices and Ill tell you, it all changed. Now Im asking sleepy Joe Biden to give me a list and he doesnt want to do it. You know why Because he can only put super radical left judges on, people that would destroy our country, people that would destroy your country. And he knows that hes not electable He shouldnt be electable anyway. This is the worst candidate. You know where he is today They have a thing called the LID. I dont even know. Do you know what LID stands for LID. He put out a LID today early in the morning. LID means hes not going to be anywhere today. Im working my ass off, Im in Ohio, Im in Texas, Im in Florida, Im in Michigan, Im in Wisconsin. Man. Thank you. Thats so nice. Well, that is something that one of the fake news reporters back there, they said theyve never heard of that one. There was a chant thats going over the last six or seven rallies saying, We love you. Thats never happened to a politician before. Am I a politician I dont want to be a politician. I dont think of myself as a politician. But it really is, I appreciate it. Ive never heard it. I liked Ronald Reagan, but they never said we love you, or maybe they did. Theyre going to try and find out. Then theyll say, President Trump lied last night because 40 years ago I remember But no, nobodys ever heard that one before and I appreciate it because it is reciprocal. Thank you very much. Reciprocal. Reciprocal love. Its reciprocal. I had such a nice life before I did this. I had such a nice life. Then I had the witch hunt that goes on forever. It goes on. And then we catch them spying on our campaign. How about that Lets see what happens though. But we caught them spying, all of that, the whole big deal. And then the guys that were doing the investigation, they have their 31 different phones, they were accidentally wiped clean. 31 different phones, I think it was like 19 different people, and they all did the same exact accident. Which if you knew anything about phones, its almost an impossibility to do it once. Let alone 31 different times. So we caught them and thats called obstruction. We have to remember thats called obstruction. That was the Mueller group. That was a Mueller group. All those phones, they were wiped so clean. And Hillary got a subpoena on the 30. I said, Forget about these things because youll find them. They have them. Theyre in the state department. I have no doubt about it, theyre in the state department but theyll get them. But you know what 33,000, they have a request from the US Congress, thats not bad, US Congress they send a subpoena, very, very important, and after getting the subpoena, she deleted all of her emails and acid washed, and then she took her telephones. Ive gotten rid of phones too. I throw them away. She took cameras and she beat the hell out of them with a hammer and then threw them away. And they found a couple of them. She was very angry, obviously, if she did the hammer work. But if anyone else said this, theres a protection, theres a dual level of justice, but were getting down to the bottom of it because its not fair to us. Not fair to us. 33,000 emails. She deleted them on the basis that it was all about her daughters wedding, Chelsea, and also yoga classes. 33,000 emails on yoga and a wedding. I dont think so. And Comey said, Oh, thats okay. That sounds like a good reason. Thats Comey. Thats another beauty right there that Comey. But we caught him, we caught him. Very smart move. Getting rid of that guy was a smart move, but we caught him. Listen, we caught him. They were spying on the campaign, they were doing actually worse than that. Nobodys ever done a thing like this, so lets see what happens. But we caught him cold, we got so much stuff. Remember the insurance policy, right From Strzok and Page, two lovers. They were very smart. They would use the public servers and send it over the public wires because they didnt want to be caught having an affair. So they went over the public. That was a very good thing for us. Wasnt it  Darling, darling, darling, please. Shes going to win. Shes going to win, isnt she Peter, Peter only you can save us. Peter, shes going to win. Yes, darling. Shes going to win. I know. 100,000 to nothing. Remember that It was actually 100 million to one. This was a hundred million to one. This is this idiot. So listen, So darling, please, please tell me again. Yes, 100 million to one shes going to win. But just in case she doesnt, we have an insurance policy. Now that only means one thing. And we went through the insurance policy and we caught them. So lets see what happens to these treasonous crooks. These terrible people. And they put our nation through turmoil. But I just want to thank A lot of people were very unfairly treated. You look at General Flynn, look, hes still going through it. Can you believe it But a lot of people were unfairly treated by a bunch of treasonous, horrible people. And they used the intelligence agencies of our country to try and steal an election and to try and do a coup. Wouldnt you think Who would ever think this country But thats all you can say. Some people would say, Well, thats a conspiracy theory. No, just take a look at the records. For me, its a very exciting thing because we found something that nobody would have thought possible. Now lets see what happens. But we have them cold, they spied on our campaign. Its our campaign And if you want to save America, you have to go out, get out and vote. This is the most important election. In just three and a half years weve secured Americas borders, which makes them very unhappy, rebuilt the awesome power of the US military, we built the military. It was totally depleted when I took over. We built a military. Two and a half trillion dollars we spent, all made in the USA, the greatest equipment, the greatest planes and rockets and missiles and our nuclear. I hate to even mention the word and hope to God we never have to use it, but we have the most powerful weapons in the history of the world. And we did that over a very short period of time. Weapons that are so powerful that were the envy of the world, but I never want to use those weapons. And hopefully well never have to. You know the way you dont have to use them, is when you have them. Its when you have them. But nobodys ever built force like what we have. And the newspapers and the press and the fake news they went and said, He just gave away classified information I said, No, I will look you right in the eye, first of all, Im allowed to do it, Im the president, so Im allowed to actually. Im the only one thats allowed to. But no, no, I didnt give away. Im just telling you, most powerful weapons ever produced we have, and other countries know that. And its a good thing that they know it and I dont think well ever be using them. And I hope we dont. I hope to God. I use the word God, because they refuse to use the word God in their pledge of allegiance, right Twice. I use the word God. I hope to God, we never have to use them. But I obliterated the ISIS caliphate, which was all over the place. 100%. Remember I got it down to 99%. They said, You got to go a hundred. I said, Lets get out of here. Were bringing them all back home. Everyones coming back home. Long, long wars. The never ending wars, the endless wars. We fixed our disastrous trade deals, they were a disaster, brought jobs and factories back to Pennsylvania under 16 years. And think of this, for 16 years presidents, Obama, President Bush, household income rose 2,945. Thats over a 16 year period. In three years, your household income rose almost 10,000. When you include energy. You have to include energy. Without energy, almost 7,000. But we have to include energy. I mean, how much are you paying for your gasoline You never saw 2 gasoline. Less, right Its less. They go up, its less. Its a big difference. What is it nowadays Come on, tell me. I havent got any gas. I havent stopped recently at a gas station. 15 Okay. Because for a while it was way under two. And were going to keep it there. We have so much, we have so much. In my first three years we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction in the history of our country, by far. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And right now were doing it again. I see all these hats, Make America Great Again. And now Im going to say this, Make America Great Again, Again. Make America Great Again, Again, Again. We saved 1.4 million jobs in Pennsylvania alone and to fight the China virus, its the China virus, not the coronavirus. Corona sounds like a place in Italy, a beautiful place. Its corona. No, its the China virus. They dont want to say it. The radical left, they dont want to say it. You ever notice theyre always going to have to Russia. Look, nobodys been tougher on Russia than me. Russia, Russia, Russia. I said, What about China They never going to to mention it. They got little deals going on I think. But coronavirus, doesnt it sound like Italy A beautiful villa. Corona. No, its a China virus. They should have stopped it. To fight the China virus we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We did an A job, except we did a D job in terms of public relations, explaining it because we were too busy doing it. But the fact is they wouldnt have written it anyway. It didnt matter to them. Its there. Its their little thing. You have a watch Biden He cant talk about it he thinks, so he gets up, The coronavirus, they say, We want to talk about Supreme Court judge today. Well, I dont know about that. The coronavirus. And he doesnt know we did a great job, he has no clue. He said, I should have opened. He goes, I should have shut down one week earlier. What he doesnt say is he did the worst job in the history of an epidemic or a pandemic with the swine flu. It was a joke. And what he did, his own man, that was in charge said recently, We had no idea what the hell we were doing. It was a total disaster. There were amateurs. And now he tells us how to do something thats far more lethal. But he said,  They should have closed one week early, except when it came to closing the border, which I did, which turned out to save tens of thousands of lives, Biden criticized me until two months later when he said I was right. But we should have closed a weak earlier. Think of that. We pioneered lifesaving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that. Remdesivir, the plasmas, we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country. Nobody knows that. And I am devastated to see it happening, but you see whats going on in Europe again. They were always saying, Oh, Europe is doing better. Actually we did better, but now Europe has a big spike, a big spike. So theyre not talking about that. The number of hospitalized virus patients is down by 47% and virus patients coming to the emergency room is down and visits are way down, visits to hospital. Europe has almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. Theyre liking to compare us to Europe. 50% greater excess mortality rate. Our early and aggressive action saved millions of lives through Operation Warp Speed. Youve heard about it, they dont want to talk about it. What weve done in a record period of time with the ventilators, now were building ventilators for the world. Very hard to do. Well develop and distribute a vaccine very, very shortly in record time, it would have been two or three years, four years, if Bidens group had done it, but weve done a great job with the FDA in clearing a path and youll be seeing it very shortly. And these are great companies that are doing it. So well crush the virus and our opponents will, with him, they will crush America. We cant let it happen. This country is too great. Our love of each other is too great. This guy doesnt know hes alive. He really doesnt. He doesnt know hes alive. He did an ad on an anonymous source that said about me making a statement about military soldiers that died. And it was such a disgusting thing. I said, The only good thing about it is now I can take the gloves off. This guy doesnt have a clue. He doesnt know where the hell he is and theyll give him a shot of something. I dont know, hes going to get something. Because I watched him so badly, he performed so badly in the debates, and then with Bernie, he was average, not great, but he got through and I said, What the hell is he taking And wed like to ask him. And I said that, We want a drug test, we want a drug test. Well both take it. Well both take it. Because with Bernie he was able to get through. But listen, it wasnt Winston Churchill. This wasnt the greatest, but he got through, it was fine. Him and Bernie screaming at each other, mostly Bernie. Crazy Bernie. Hes not too happy. Ill tell you, did you ever see a better loser than Bernie though Seriously. Hes a good loser. He got terribly treated by Hillary and that group. And then it happened again with Elizabeth Warren, right It happened again. What the Democrat party did to him. And then you have this guy, Mike Bloomberg, mini Mike, one question and he was gone. There goes 1.8 billion out their window. I said, You think its easy up here, Mike, dont ya One question and that was the end. He said, Where am I Get me the hell off of this platform. Mini Mike, mini Mike. So now hes trying to buy into the party. You would think after the way they treated him, they called him every name, Pocahontas destroyed him, she didnt do good against me, but boy did she do good against Mini Mike. I figured hed be calling and saying, Listen, I want to become a Republican. Weve done great for the economy, youd think. But he always wanted to run for president, and he tried before, I guess, but he tried and it was a bad experience. And you would think he would have joined our party. But instead hes trying to buy his way back in. When somebody treats you that way, even stay neutral, dont go back in. He wants to give them a lot of money to try and buy their friendship. And one thing you learned about politics, I spent a fraction of the money that crooked Hillary spent. They raised 2 billion. I spent my own money, but I spent a fraction of the money I spent my own money, but I spent a fraction of the money, like 35%, 30%, and we won. Nobody ever says that. Its not about money. Its about other things. There are other things involved. Its not just about money. In the old days, my father would teach me, If you can win and spend less, thats a good thing. I remember after I won and I won decisively look, 306 to 223. Thats a lot. 306 delegates, 306, thats decisive. We won Michigan and were going to win it again. Were up in a poll just now. Oh, theyre going crazy. Theyre going crazy. We won Wisconsin. We won Pennsylvania. But my father taught me. He said, If you can win and spend less money, thats a good thing, not a bad thing. Thats a good thing, not a bad thing. Like if you get along with the leaders of other lands and dont go to war all the time with everybody and can come out on top without having to shed blood all over the place and destroy your families and your country, like when I get along with Putin, when I get along with Kim Jong-un. Whatever happened to the war we were supposed to be in with North Korea Nothing happened. They said I gave away so much. I said, What did I give away They couldnt find that anything. I didnt do anything. They said, You met. Oh, I met. Oh, okay. I met. Now you would have been in war with her. You would have been in war. But if you can spend, think of this, if you can spend less money and win, thats a good thing. So after I won one of these people back there, right back there-  in order to keep the thing going on Trump, I had won, he said, But Trump raised substantially less money than crooked Hillary Clinton. Thats because I didnt need the money. I didnt need the money. I can call up a lot of rich guys that raised a lot of money, but I feel uncomfortable doing it because when you do that, its like youre sort of  Its not the same. I could call up every guy. They call me up and they say, Sir, how are you, sir Mr. President, sir. I have friends see. I dont have too many friends up because I used to be comfortable. You have to be comfortable with people, right I have friends, I have one friend, Richard. I talk about him all the time, but multiply this times a hundred people. Richard used to call me up five, six years ago. Hey, lets have dinner. All right. Where do you want to go I dont know. Go to some crazy restaurant. Today the restaurants are all closed in New York. They dont want to open them. They want to make them do badly until November but dont worry, theyre opening in November 4th. But its true. So, its Richard on the phone, Richard, my friend for many, many years. I said, Hey Richard, how are you doing Mr. President sir, how are you I said, Well   Hes been calling Donnie and Don and DJ, and all. Richard, are you okay Everything good Yes, sir. Mr. President, sir. Youre doing a great job and Id like to thank you. Good, Richard. Richard, loosen up please. You dont have to call me Mr. Parson. I said, Just call me Donald. Its okay. Thank you Donald. I really appreciate it. And you hear the guy cant breathe. Hes having a hard time breathing. Hes very nervous. Then at the end of the phone, he goes, Mr. President again, thank you so much for the job you do, and he hangs up. I said, how can you be friends with   It just doesnt work. Its like, Ive lost a lot of people this way. Its called respect for the office. They have respect for the office. They really do. Nothing wrong with it. I sort of understand that. They have respect for the office. Nobody has more respect for this offices than I do. Thats why Im doing a great job, and Ill always do a great job. Its respect for the office. But on November 3rd, Pennsylvania, will decide whether we end the pandemic, defeat the virus and return to record prosperity just like we were before, or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden, who doesnt have a clue, to kill the recovery, raise your taxes, delay the vaccine. So he wants to impose a 4 trillion tax. Do you believe 4 trillion. Ban American energy, which means what Hey, lets go back. Lets call up the Middle East and lets be real nice to them because we need their energy. No, thank you. Destroy your suburbs. You know, I got rid of this regulation that was going to destroy your suburbs. Destroy your suburbs. I call it the Obama Regulates. Theyre building nice projects right next to your beautiful home. Lots of luck. Give free healthcare. I hope the people in the suburbs  When I did this, I took a lot of heat. I got rid of a regulation. They all said, Sir, well amend the regulation. Were going to amend it. I said, I dont want to amend it. A couple of stories where written. I wish the women living in the suburbs would read these stories. They were written by people that say, I cant believe a president had the guts to do it. I did because I want to save the American dream. By the way, a big part of the American dream are minorities who made it and they want to live in the suburbs and they dont want to be next to a project. Remember Sleepy Joe. Hell do it because he has no choice because they have total power. Hes like a puppet for them and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies. To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we are launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and getting better every single day. Were not going to let it fail. The Democrat party has joined forces with flag burners, anarchists, anti-police people, theyre extremist. Agitators. And then they say, Oh no, no, this was a peaceful protest. This is a peaceful protest. They know what Im talking about. They know our great uniform. Brilliant. We love them, but you know what We call it a peaceful protest now, because the only thing youre allowed to do in Pennsylvania, cant go to church, right You cant meet, you cant congregate. You cant look at each other. You cant give your wife a kiss goodnight. Youve got to wear a mask. You cant do anything. They got you closed up. Dont go out to dinner, stay where you are. Michigan, same thing like the governor. Her husband went boating. It was a disaster because nobodys allowed. He was the only boat. He had this massive, beautiful lake. You know the lake Im talking about. Its a big lake. Theyve got to be able to do their job. Youve got to let them do their job. Got to be able to do your job, right They let you do your job, youd see. Youd see Pennsylvania, not some big, bad crime numbers in your state. You let them do your job. Any state, New Yorks finest. By the way, I got endorsed by New Yorks finest. First time theyve ever endorsed. And you know thats hard when you have radical left running the city, all politicians, the mayor. I got endorsed by the Chicago Police. Can you imagine that I got endorsed by Oklahoma and I got endorsed by Texas and Louisiana. I got endorsed by Florida, the sheriffs. All the sheriffs got together, they endorsed Trump. I got endorsed by law enforcement, everybody. But how could you possibly endorse people that hate you and dont respect the job you do, and dont let you do your job most importantly Because if they let you do what you do better than anybody else in the world, you wouldnt have problems. These are other police departments. You look at Seattle. We said were going in, and they immediately said, Well put up our hands. It was so easy. We were going in the following day. You look at Portland. How about Portland Its like an anarchists dream. Were dealing with the governor, because you know, I hate to say it, but theyre all Democrat-run cities and states. All of them, every single one. The Republicans are doing great, but they have to ask. By law, they have to ask us to go in. But do you remember that beautiful day It was 10 days late. You had these people from CNN and other places. These are friendly protests. Thats a lovely thing to say. As hes getting rocks and cans of tuna fish. They go out to buy tuna fish and soup. You know that, right Goya. I hope Goya, hes great, isnt he Good guy. They go out and buy Goya because they throw it. They throw it. Its the perfect weight, tuna fish they can really rip it, and that hits you. No, its true. Bumblebee brand tuna, and you can throw it at soccer, you can a curve on it. You can do whatever else you want. The cops in Chicago, you saw, theyre going like this. It was terrible. Theyre not allowed to fight back. Theyre not allowed to fight back. These guys if they fight back, nobodys going to be there very long throwing things. But theyre professionals, theyre anarchists. Theyre paid for by outside stupid rich people that  Theyre stupid people. By the way, you know the first ones that get wiped out They dont have a shot by the way, Ill tell you that, but if they ever did, the first ones that would get wiped out are the stupid people that gave them the money to do this stuff. Those are the people that would get wiped out. But you know, theyre very smart. Everything is perfect. Do you ever see where they drop the bricks along the thing in a bag Then they drop, everyone picks them up, throws them at our great police. Were not going to let that stuff happen, but this is all a Democrat. It doesnt happen with Republicans. I was with Greg Abbott. I was with Ron DeSantis, Texas and Florida and other governors that cant even believe a thing like that could happen, but they get caught. Theyre walking up. Therere like 30 cans of soup. They have like 25 cans of tuna. They get caught. Im bringing this home to my family. How dare you stop me No, no, no. They use it as ammunition. Its terrible shame. But he went down and he didnt like it. He was hit. Police brutality. You remember that They walked in, and theyve got the tear gas. Theyve got everything you can possibly have. Pepper spray. They dont want you to use tear gas anymore. In some places like I think in Milwaukee, they said no tear gas, no pepper spray. How the hell do you keep big crowds back You cant. So the police all quit. They all quit. They said, We cant do it. But you remember, they went out and you had one, then you had two, three, four, then you had five, six, seven. All of a sudden they started pouring in. They were getting off the buses. They came from a different locale, and then you had a line of them and there was no social distancing unfortunately. In fact, I was going to turn them in because they were right next to each other. They were right next to each other. They were touching arms and they had big, strong arms like these guys right over here. There were big strong guys. Thats all right. They were like together. Then you saw the first line. Then you saw the second line, then you saw a third line, and then you saw a fourth line. Then they said, March. They never halted. Just walked right through, cleaned everything up, and Minneapolis was cured. They were cured. They grabbed them. They grabbed them. They grabbed them. They were grabbing them left and right. Sometimes they grabbed, they grabbed one guy, Im a reporter. Im a reporter. Get out of here. They throw him aside like he was a little bag of popcorn. But no, but I mean, honestly, when you watch the crap that weve all had to take so long, when you see that, its actually  You dont want to do that, but when you see it, its actually a beautiful sight. Its a beautiful sight. Behind him was like 10 blocks of fire was  Id never. Its a classic. I dont know. Anybody, you know what Im talking about Is it  So, I just have such respect, but you have to let these great professionals do what they do best. You have to let them do what they  Its called law and order. We need law and order. So, Democrat phenomena. If they win, Sleepy Joe, if they win, because he has no power over these people, these people are crazed lunatics. If they win, your cities will be like this. Youll lose all rights. Your constitution will be worthless. Itll be a terrible, terrible thing. Im not even sure that, after some time listening to that and going along with it, Im not even sure the country can ever recover. Thats how bad it would be. Im not sure it could ever recover. Over Labor Day. Left-wing radicals rampaged through Pittsburgh, harassing diners at restaurants. I saw that one. That was horrible. No, I saw that, right I saw that. That one guy grabs a woman, a older woman, shes eating a steak. He grabbed the steak and started eating it, then he threw it back on the plate. An outdoor place, and her husband standing there like theyre afraid for their lives. It was a terrible thing, and should never be allowed to happen. A thing like that should just be closed up before it ever gets started. That was terrible. Remember that An older woman. Last week after a police officer shot a knife-wielding assailant, over 100 rioters rampaged in Lancaster. Went to school right nearby. Looting businesses, setting fires and assaulting police offices with rocks and bricks and glass. You saw that. Joe Biden has the support of violent left wing extremists. He never once mentioned the words law and order during their entire Democrat National Convention. Never once. They didnt talk about the riots, they didnt talk about anything having to do with law and order and respect and our great police. They didnt do it. They didnt talk about it. Its not a subject. They will rip your cities apart and they will go to your suburbs for all of those people in the suburbs that are ready to go about, they will go to your suburbs next. I have the support of Americas law enforcement heroes. I was recently honored to be endorsed by the largest group of police and police representatives in the country. Were endorsed by everybody. Were joined by Butler County Mike Slupe. Thank you, Mike, as well as two sheriffs who just changed their registrations, oh thats nice, to become Republicans. They were long time Democrats. Who are those two showers Wow. Thank you. Its Fayette County Sheriff James Custer and Forest County Sheriff, Bob Wolfgang. Wheres Bob Stand up, fellows. Thank you. Were you long time Democrats How the hell did that happen Well, this is somewhat of a phenomena. This is somewhat  This is crazy whats going on now. It can be stopped so easily, and you guys know exactly what Im talking about. Thank you very much. Its an honor to have you in the party. Thank you. Thats great. Theres a whole great group of sheriffs and law enforcement here. Also, with us, our Congressman Guy Russian Reschenthaler. Guy. Wheres Guy Great warrior. Where are they sitting And a friend of mine and a warrior. Hes a warrior. Hes tough as hell. They said, We want to impeach the president for making a perfect phone call. Oh, did you hear today They want to impeach me again. They said, if I submit the name of one of the most talented people in the world to be a justice of the Supreme Court, they want to impeach me. They want to impeach me if Im following the constitution. No, think of it. This is crazy Nancy. These people are stonecold crazy. Think of it. I got impeached for making a perfect phone call. Perfect phone call. Everybody read it. Nobody to this day  and the Republicans stuck together. It was great. Also, a friend of mine and he wanted to just rip them apart, I remember when he heard about it. Hes a rough guy and hes a popular guy too. They love him. Congressman Mike Kelly. Thank you, Mike. Come on up here. Come on up here. Just come up. Come on up. Mike, come up. Come on. Guy, come up. Congressmen Glenn Thompson, Congressman Dan Muser, come on. And Congressman Scott Perry. Thank you, Mike. Hey Mike, good shape. Come on, get up there. Oh what a group. What a group. Thank you. Hes the real deal. Conor lamb is just a puppet for Nancy Pelosi and crying Chuck Schumer. You know crying Chuck He cries every time he thinks its appropriate. Now, Ill tell you what. This Conor lamb turned out to be a stonecold phony. When he was running  Its a very Trump  they like me. I thought he was a Republican because his ads were so good. We have to respect our president. We have   I said, This guys doing some beautiful ads, and then I found out he was a Democrat. Ill tell you what. Hes nothing compared to Sean. Sean is the real deal. Thank you so much. Just give a little hand, because hes done a hell of a job too. Our campaign chair, Bernie Comfort. Thank you, Bernie. Bernie Comfort. Thank you. Thank you to Bernie Comfort. Thanks, Bern. All right. While you guys are standing behind me like a beautiful curtain there  Well theyre not blocking Air Force One so we could  But I have a woman with us tonight who has devoted so much. She gave up her business. She said, Dad, Im going to come to Washington and help you. I love you daddy, and were going to help people. I dont care and   She was very successful in every way, and its my daughter Ivanka. I just want to thank this group of people. And a man that helped, we just negotiated a major peace deal in the Middle East. Everyone said it was impossible. You know that, right They said its impossible. Theyve been killing everybody for years and years, they had this guy, John Kerry, whos grossly incompetent. They paid 150 billion to Iran, they paid 1.8 billion in cash. Thats even more impressive, frankly, in cash, thats John Kerry. And we just made a deal with Bahrain and UAE, United Arab Emirates, and Israel, and its a great thing. And the man right there, Jared, the abuse, the abuse he takes, but he did something that nobodys been able to do, and he wants none of the glory, hed rather not come up here. These guys will come up 100%. Jared, great deal, great job. Incredible. Everyones talking about it. We have plenty of other countries going to join and theres no blood in the sand. Okay. Thanks honey. Thank you. Great people. Thank you, Sean. Thank you, Sean. We have spent the last four years reversing the damage that Joe Biden inflicted over the last 40. They like Sean. Sean, will you please win Sean Parnell. Ill tell you, hes popular. Thats great, Sean. We love Sean. But Biden championed every globalist portrayal of Pennsylvania for half a century, he was a cheerleader for the worst trade deal ever made by any country, NAFTA and Chinas entry into the world trade organization, which built China like a rocket ship. They were flat lined for many, many decades and then right through the roof, that was a Biden approval. These disasters ripped out one third of your states manufacturing jobs. You know what happened. Biden shouldnt be asking for your vote, he should be begging for your forgiveness. He did a terrible job. Now the Democrat party is pledging to rejoin the disastrous Paris Climate Accord. You want to spend a lot of money for nothing Eviscerating your states economy, you will spend a trillion dollars and what it is really, it takes away your power, it takes away your energy. Youll be closing your plants and factories all over the place. I withdrew from it. And you know what, the people that understand, the smart people, they said, I cant believe you had the guts to do it. And I figured I was going to be absolutely killed on this one. And you know what, Im so proud I did it and people get it. It was a rip off of the United States. I withdrew from the catastrophe because I was elected to fight for Pittsburgh, not for Paris. This election is a choice between Pennsylvania and China, if Biden wins, China wins. When we win, Pennsylvania wins and America wins. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars that never ended and defending foreign borders. But now were finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops, back home in the USA where they belong. All coming home. During the pandemic, Ive suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened American jobs. As our economy reopens, I want to ensure that Americans are first in line to get the great jobs and the high wages. America first. Biden wants to flood the economy with cheap labor to replace US workers. You know that. And thats why never, never, I see his say, hire American. He got it for me, all the words hes got there, are my words, right Do you ever see it They say he copied my campaign. I keep saying, what the hell happened for 47 years and now hes copying my campaign. As president  and you know its not going to happen with him, as president, I know my first duty is always to take care of you, the American worker. Thats what were taking care of. Under my administration, weve achieved the most secure border in US history and we are finishing that wall, its going to be done so fast. Its got to be done so fast. Since 2017 ICE has successfully arrested nearly a half a million illegal aliens with criminal records, including over 145,000 assaults, 40,000 sex offenses and 5,000 murderers. If you dont mind, Democrats will bring them the hell out of our country, well get them out of here. Some of them are so violent, we have to keep them. We dont want to house them for 50 years, but if we let them go, they come back in, as much as we watch. If they come back in, we dont want it, we dont want them. So we keep them here, we have no choice. If the left gains power, they will abolish  Republicans will always  theyre going to abolish. Republicans will always stand with these incredible heroes of ICE and border patrol. You have to see these ICE people. They go into a den of MS13, and they call them a den, a nest, where you have these guys that are vicious, vicious gang members. And they go in there, they just start swinging. Its the craziest thing, they love it. Now, who wants that job Do you want that job Look, hes a tough guy sitting here, you too, youre tough guys, you dont want any part of it. Theyre just incredible and they love our country. They love our country. And then people say,  Oh, theyre too rough. Theyre too rough. You have no idea how bad some of these gangs are and what they do. They use knives because its more painful. They cut people up. They cut two young, beautiful girls, 16 years old. They were going home from school and they cut them to pieces, killed them, theyre animals. We invested 2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US armed forces in 75 years, space force. Not since the air force. Think of it, the air force was last. If I did just that, space force big deal, by the way, its going to end up being one of the most important things youve ever imagined. But if I just did that, a sixth branch of the US military, that would be a big deal. Thats like one of many, many things. We passed VA choice and VA accountability. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, they were after him for a year. We took out the worlds number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops and many others. Qasem Soleimani is gone. I withdrew from the last administrations disastrous Iran nuclear deal, one of the great disasters. And by the way, its practically expired. The crazy deal that Obama made practically expired. And his chief negotiator, he never left.  I want this. Nope. Were not giving to you. Okay, lets go on to the next one. Give me this. Nope. Give me this. Nope. Give me this. Nope. He never won a point, he lost everything. Its the worst deal Ive ever seen. And the only time he left the table is to go on a bicycle ride and he crashed and broke his leg and his arm. And I promised everybody I would never go riding in a bicycle race. I swear to you. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. That was a 52 year development that I got done in about a day. Theyd been negotiating that sovereignty over the Golan Heights, I got it done immediately. 52 years, they worked on that. But instead of endless war, we are forging peace in the Middle East. Its so great. Peace in the Middle East. So Bidens put forward a platform that would end America as we know it. And this is true. I dont think of him as a radical lefty, but basically hes controlled by them. And what about this Kamala How about her She at 15%, no, shes at 13%. Then people started  no shes at 12. No, shes at 10. Shes at nine, shes at seven. These are a poll numbers. She got worse than worse. She quit before she ever got to Iowa. We have a great vice president, Mike Pence. Hes great and he says hello. If elected, Biden would destroy social security and destroy protections for preexisting conditions, people with preexisting conditions, drain your Medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants. Theyre all going to come in. If you have that, the problem is were going to give you healthcare, theyre going to all pour into the United States and our country cant afford it. We want to be nice, we all have hearts, country cant afford it. They would get people that never even thought of coming if they see that. Cant do it. They would end our travel bans on jihadist regions. We have very strong  remember I got travel bans. Everyone thought it was such a terrible thing, such a terrible person. Hes such a terrible person. Im such a bad guy, I got travel bans. And increase refugee admissions by more than 700%, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. Ban school choice and all charter schools, theyre very important. In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. All Americans, race, color, creed, all Americans. So in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China, once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, right here in Pennsylvania. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. Wed ban them. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. Thank you. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless, ridiculous, stupid foreign wars. We losing our youth to countries that youd never even heard of, right Never even heard of them. We will maintain Americas unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will surprise, think of the surprise medical billing, were going to end it, surprise. You ever walk into a hospital, oh, gee, fix you up. Oh, great. Then you get a bill for 2,000 for a band-aid. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which Ive already signed and brilliantly starts on January 1st. Hey, you better vote for me. You know, I think thats, in a way, bigger than healthcare. Can you imagine Biden if he won Price transparency is so big, its all done, it starts on January 1st. How smart is that How smart. And youre going to see numbers and reductions like youve never seen. Could you imagine if he were president, Sir, our medical costs have dropped in half price. Transparency has been unbelievable. What is that What is price transparency And theyll explain it to him. He still wont have a clue. But can you imagine giving him credit I signed it, its all done. It starts on January 1st. I say, Why cant you start it now, just in case And know what they said, Sir, statutorily, it has to start then. I said, All right, lets go. But I know were going to win, so its not going to matter. And were going to further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We have a favored nations laws, well now we get the same price as all these nations that are paying a tiny fraction, which should have been instituted a long time ago. And the drug companies are going after me with those ads. Oh, its terrible, terrible. You know why Just every time you see an add from the drug company, they got plenty of money, thats why nobody ever fights them. Anytime you see an ad from a drug company, just remember one thing, your drug prices are coming down. Thats what it means. Thats what it means. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security and we will always protect patients. We will protect every single patient. America will land, by the way, the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. You know, NASA was an absolute disaster, grass was growing through the fairways too. They had fairways, thats about all they use, were the fairways. And now we have something, right through the runways, the landing strips, it was all grass infested, it was all weed infested, and now its the number one space center in the world, by far. It was a closed up mess. And we have rich guys sending up rockets, Elon and others. They send up rockets and we say, let them keep going. Let them keep spending money on these rockets. They love rockets. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words in our national motto, in God, we trust. For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Pennsylvania, like nobody has ever stood up before. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and your coworkers, and get out and vote And early voting, if you didnt know it, has already begun and watch it and watch those fake ballots, you got to go out and turn them in. If you see somebody cheating, you got to turn them in, from Erie  and you probably will, its going to be a mess, watch this. But get out and vote early. From Erie to Eastern, from Altoona to Scranton, from Harrisburg to right here in Pittsburgh. Say hello to big Ben. We stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for their beloved country. This is the state where our founding fathers declared American independence, right This is the state. Such history, such history. Its where the army, weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, I know it well. Where George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware and where our union was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg. Gettysburg, one of the great, great, incredible sights of history, Gettysburg. So vicious, so horrible and yet so beautiful and so historic, right Incredible. Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mine the coal, work the railroads, forge the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater, greater, greater than ever before. Not even close, not even close, its what were doing, were doing it together. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you."
Toledo,Jan9,2020,"Well, thank you very much. Vice President Mike Pence, great job youre doing. And hello Toledo We love Toledo. You remember, I was here a lot. You remember 2016, what a year that was, right And 2020 is going to be even better, no doubt. But Im thrilled to hold the first rally of 2020 right here in the great state of Ohio. And as we begin the new year, our economy is booming, wages are soaring, workers are thriving, and Americas future has never, ever looked brighter, ever. Were the envy of every country in the world. Weve created seven million brand new jobs since our election. And we will soon be replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the incredible brand new USMCA, the historic victory for Ohio farmers, workers, and manufacturers, but really a great victory for the United States. Its an incredible agreement. You remember I came and Id always talk about how bad our trade deals are. We did a brand new one with Korea. So now we have South Korea, we just finished a big one, 40 billion with Japan. On January 15, were signing a monster, a big beautiful monster, 40 to 50 billion to our farmers. Our farmers will be taking in, I keep saying go buy larger tractors. Go buy larger tractors. I said theres no way, I dont know if you know this story, my people wanted 20 billion to purchase, right 20 billion, 20, thats a lot money, thats a lot of corn, 20 billion, and I said, Make it 50. Chinas very big. And they said, Okay. They said, Sir, the farmers cant produce that much. I said, Let the farmers tell me that. Tell them to go out and, remember, and buy a bigger what Tractor, buy a bigger tractor. Youll produce it. So 40 to 50 billion of agriculture product and the manufacturers and the car companies, and we brought a lot of car companies into Ohio, you know that. A lot of them are coming in. A lot of them have already been brought in. Theyre coming in from Japan, theyre coming in from all over the world. This is where they want to be. They want to be in the United States. This is where the action is. Theyre all coming back. I used to go around and talk about how everyones leaving. They were all leaving. A lot of you were victims of that leaving. These companies would leave, theyd go to Mexico, theyd go to Canada, theyd close up, theyd buy from China. Now theyre all coming back, new ones, old ones, theyre all coming back, and many are coming right here to Ohio. And just in case you didnt know it, Ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state. Thats not bad, thats not bad. And this years going to be even better and maybe much better. But weeks ago, I signed the largest ever investment in the United States military,  738 billion, and we created the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force, and everybodys excited about that. After years and years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the United States military. Some of its still coming in. We have everything. Weve got new planes, weve got new rockets, new missiles, weve got new everything, and its either here or coming in, 2.5 trillion in new investments. So our military is now stronger and more powerful than ever before. And if you remember, three years ago when I took over, we were depleted. Our military was totally depleted. And by the way, speaking of our military, have we taken care of our vets with Choice, with Choice. That was a big thing. You know, I used to go around and the VA was a terrible situation. People would wait weeks. Hes right, he said, Yes, it was. You dont hear too much about that anymore, have you noticed Choice and accountability, you know what accountability is For 44 years, they tried to get accountability. Thats somebody bad, works for the VA, you couldnt fire them. You couldnt fire them. They could be sadistic, they could be thieves, they could be whatever they were, you couldnt get rid of them. We got accountability approved, and now we say, Youre fired, get out. We get somebody thats good. 44 years, and maybe most importantly of all is Choice, VA, Veterans Choice. So you now wait in line, and a lot of times youd wait in line for four or five, six weeks you couldnt see a doctor. Now you dont have to wait. You go out to a private doctor, you get yourself taken care of, we pay the bill. What a difference its made. What a difference its made. You know, when I was a little bit newer to this game Thats okay, they got it, they got it. They go home to mommy. Go on home to mommy. Go on home to mommy. Its a beautiful sight. Thank you, security. Do we love law enforcement, by the way So with the VA, I used to go around saying, Why dont they do that Why dont these people, why dont they go to a private doctor and work something out And I thought it was a brilliant plan. I said, Im telling you I am such a smart guy. I said, This is the most brilliant thing ever. And I went back to my people and I said, I have an idea. A veterans sick, they cant get the kind of service they need, they need a certain kind of doctor, I have an idea, such a great idea. You get to go out, private, youre going to pick out a doctor, youre going to get yourself fixed up. Were going to pay the bill, right And you know what happened And I said, How brilliant is that They said, Sir, weve been working on that for 48 years, but weve never been able to get it approved. So I was very, very disillusioned, but you know what Im good at Getting things approved. And we got it approved. So we signed that 11 months ago, and what a difference thats made in terms of your lines and in terms of peoples health. People would wait online for weeks, and some people werent very sick and theyd end up being terminally ill. They couldnt get to see the doctor. Now they go out, they get a doctor, we take care of them. We can take care of our vets. So were using this great power not to pursue conflict, but to really preserve, and I mean in the true sense of the word, preserve peace. We have this tremendous military, and you know what that is Thats really a great fighting force, but I hope we never have to use it. I really do. You saw an example of that a couple of days ago. So we seek friends, not enemies, but if you dare to threaten our citizens, you do so at your own grave peril. Weve never had a military, what we have now, weve never had anything like it. We were looking at planes that were old and tired, 50, 60-year-old planes. Youve heard the story, the grandfather flew them, the son flew them, the current wonderful person flew them, the whole family flew them. Those are all gone now, folks. Those are all gone. In October of last year, US Special Operations Forces executed a daring nighttime raid that killed the bloodthirsty founder and leader of ISIS. The animal known as al- Baghdadi is dead. And the entire ISIS caliphate is destroyed, and his terrorist empire, and he was indeed a monster, has been totally demolished. We killed thousands and thousands of ISIS warriors, fighters, and we have thousands of them right now locked up where they should be. Nobody has ever done what weve done in three years. And Ill say this, when we took it over, it was a mess. We did it in a short period of time, but when we took it over, it was not good. And last week, the United States once again took the bold and decisive action to save American lives and deliver American justice. And you know what Im talking about. For years, the sadistic mass murderer, Qasam Soleimani, planned and executed attacks against American targets, killing and wounding thousands of US service members and many, many thousands, and even hundreds of thousands, of other people. As the leader of Irans terrorist Quds Force, Soleimani spread death, destruction, and mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond. He ordered the violent assault on the American embassy in Baghdad. And you saw this was the anti-Benghazi. We got there very quickly. We got there very quickly. This is the exact opposite, we did it exactly the opposite of Benghazi, where they got there so late, all they saw when they got there days later were burning embers from the days before. Thats all they saw. We got there very early. We saw what was happening. I saw what was happening, and I said, Whats that all about And that was going to be another Benghazi. Had they broken through the final panels of glass, they were breaking and breaking it, had they gotten through, we would have had either hundreds of dead people or hundreds of hostages. That wasnt going to happen. And I called up our great generals, and I said, Get them over there now. And one of our leaders, one of our really admired people, said, Sir, well have them there tomorrow. I said, Nope, get in the planes right now, have them there immediately, and they got there immediately, fortunately. But he directed the recent rocket strikes that wounded four American service members, badly wounded, and killed an American citizen. That was just before we happened to hit him. Soleimani was actively planning new attacks and he was looking very seriously at our embassies, and not just the embassy in Baghdad. But we stopped him, we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold. So at my direction, the United States military eliminated Qasam Soleimani and ended his rampage through not only that part of the world, but much bigger parts of the world, he was all over. He was a bad guy, he was a bloodthirsty terror and hes no longer a terror, hes dead. And yet now I see the radical left Democrats have expressed outrage over the termination of this horrible terrorist. And you know, instead they should be outraged by Soleimanis savage crimes and the fact that his countless victims were denied justice for so long. He was the king of the roadside bomb. You know of the roadside bomb, and then they got bigger, and hed send them over to Afghanistan and Iraq. And when you see our friends and our great wounded warriors and our great warriors, when you see them without their legs and without arms and with so much damage, its most likely that he caused that damage, because thats what he liked. He loved planting the roadside bomb. So now hes gone, and thats a good thing. Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie, has condemned the US military strike on Soleimani, the worlds top terrorist, think of it, the worlds top terrorist, and were having people like Nancy Pelosi, thats a real genius, do you believe that one Nancy, nervous Nancy. But heres a guy who slaughtered and butchered civilians all over and military, whoever was in his way, and we have Bernie and Nancy Pelosi, we have them all, theyre all trying to say, How dare you take him out that way You should get permission from Congress. You should come in and tell us what you want to do. You should come in and tell us so that we can call up the fake news thats back there and we can leak it. Thats a lot of corruption back there, folks. No, but think, seriously, so they want me So these are split-second decisions. You have to make a decision. So they dont want me to make that decision. They want me to call up, maybe go over there, let me go over to Congress, or come on over to the White House, lets talk about it. When can you make it Well, I wont be able to make it today, sir, so how about say in a couple of days Oh, good, come on over. No, we got a call, we heard where he was, we knew the way he was getting there, and we had to make a decision. We didnt have time to call up Nancy, who is not operating with a full deck. No, they want us to call, can you imagine calling crooked Adam Schiff Hes so crooked, hes so crooked. Shifty Schiff and say, Gee, Adam, how are you doing Listen, we have the worlds number one terrorist, killed thousands and thousands of people. Wed like to set up a meeting so we can discuss his execution. Would you be willing to meet Well, I wont be able to make it this week. Well, you know, hes traveling fast. We got him lined up, Adam, you little pencil-neck. Nine inches. He buys the smallest shirt collar you can get, and its loose. Now come on, Adam, we got to meet faster on it. We got to take this guy out. Were not going to have another shot at him maybe ever again. But I cant make it now because Im trying to impeach Trump, Im trying to impeach, even though he did nothing wrong. By the way, did you see, I did nothing wrong. They dont even know what in the hell is going on. In fact, its so weak, she doesnt want to put in the articles, its so weak. Theyre so pathetic. Theyre so pathetic. So they want us to call them. Now, Schiff is a big leaker. He leaks to crazy CNN. See with the little red light on over there. Not too many people are watching CNN. But he leaks. So hell say, You know, off the record, I got to hurry up because everyones watching me in the hallway on my cell phone, off the record theyve got the number one terrorist in the world, Soleimani, and theyre going to get him, theyre going to take him out in the next 10 minutes. Please, dont tell anybody I told you. So we have breaking news, President Trump within the next 20, 25 minutes, looks to be taking out terrorist General Soleimani. Hes going to do it. It should be happening in about the next 20 minutes, 19, 18, 17. Then we get back to the battlefield, howd you do, fellas I dont know, sir, he disappeared. I dont know what happened to him. They want us to tell them so that they can leak it to their friends in the corrupt media. You got to say though, thats a lot of media, right Thats the way the Academy Awards used to look when it was successful. Then they started hitting us all the time and it became unsuccessful. I love it, I love it, actually. Oh, they have some bad ones here tonight. They have some really bad ones, some really sick ones. They have one good one, by the way, one good one. They have one good one, a bunch of bad ones. Very, very dishonest people and we have some great ones, too. We have some great journalists, great reporters. But youve got a tremendous amount of dishonest media people like I have never seen in my life before. They write things that they know are wrong. They write, if you watched for the last three years, think of it, and then they get Pulitzer Prizes, but it turned out to be all wrong. How do you do that They get Pulitzer Prizes for being wrong. The Pulitzer Prize doesnt mean a thing. It doesnt mean a thing. I mean, Im here to tell you about the Nobel Peace Prize. Ill tell you about that. I made a deal. I saved a country. And I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Noble Peace Prize for saving the country. I said, Did I have something to do with it Yeah, but you know, thats the way it is. As long as we know, thats all that matters. I saved a big war. I saved a couple of them. But under my administration, we will never make excuses for Americas enemies, we will never hesitate in defending American lives, and we will never stop working to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, never. And nobodys done it like weve done it. And its we, its we. Its not me, its we. Its a whole movement. There has, by the way, never been a movement like this. You know, outside, I dont know what this place holds, its like 10, 11,000 people, right Outside you have thousands and thousands of people that want to get in. Theres never been a movement like this. Theres never been a movement like this. And Ill tell you, maybe Im wrong, but this is bigger than it was in 2016, because in 2016 I said what were going to do, but now Ive completed more promises than Ive made. I mean, Ive actually completed more, right Like, as an example, many of you were here, look at all those beautiful red hats, keep America great, thats good. But I never talked about, did you ever hear me prior to the election talk about Space Force I never talked about it. We did Space Force, but did we ever speak about it No. There were many things that weve done that we never spoke about, right Right to Try, you know about Right to Try, right Theyve been trying to get it for 44 years, Right to Try. Thats people that are very sick, terminally ill, and they cant get medicine that possibly works. And very well, we have the greatest labs and the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest scientists in the world, we have the greatest medicines in the world. If they have something that theyre pretty sure is going to work but is going to take another six years, I brought those times way back, by the way, way down, but they would travel to Asia, they would travel to Europe, they would travel all over the world to try and get a cure because we wouldnt sell them the medicine because we didnt want to take a chance on making the people sick. I said, Wait a minute, theyre going to die. Theyre going to die. Well, sir, we cant take the liability. I said, Then well draw up a statement assessing all liability, taking all liability away from the country, away from the insurance companies, away from the healthcare companies, away from the doctors. And with the great help of a lot of incredible Republicans, and we had some Democrats help us, we passed Right to Try, and you have to see how this works. Some people are being, many people are being saved. And you know, the drug companies didnt like it because they didnt want to take people that sick, because they didnt want it on their charts. I said, I understand that. We wont include that. Well have a separate list over here. They said, Oh, would you do that I said, Yeah, Ill do that, Ill do that. But I didnt talk about Right to Try. I never said I was going to get that done, we got it done. That was a tough one to get done. It sounds simple, but it was tough. Theres nothing easy in this country. You know, they said to me, a friend of mine the other day, Whos the toughest country to deal with, President He used to call me Donald. Ive known this guy for a long time. Id like to say 20 years, but its much more than that. I just dont want to tell you how long, its too long. And I said, Call me Donald. Youve always called me Donald. I cant. He calls me Mr. President. Ive known this guy forever. He used to call me, Hey, Donald, lets go out to dinner. You know before, hed go, Hey, lets go out to dinner. Now he goes, Mr. President, sir, how are you Right How are you But what weve done, and he said, he told me, What youve done, weve never seen anything like it. So many people are saying that. We are all together doing something, not only in terms of the election, not only in terms of what were doing right now. Dont forget, its a long way to the election. You know, we have what, 10 months Thats a long way. This is my first stop of the year, first major stop of the year. This is it. And we start. By the way, lets do one of those polls right now, do you mind Is there anything more fun than a Trump rally Here we are. Anything more fun than a Trump rally Here we are. We have the greatest phrase of all time, Make America Great Again, and all due respect, Ill never end  Im a little superstitious. Ill never end it, Make America Great Again, but I see all those hats. I see all those hats, changing it a little bit, but Make America Great Again. I said, you know, today, we just hit the highest stock price in the history of our country. Your 401ks are at records, your stocks are great, but what it really means to me is jobs, more importantly, than anything else. We have the best jobs, the best everything, right We just hit  I cant really say, Make America Great Again. Our military is rebuilt, 2.5 trillion. Our military is rebuilt. Were doing great numbers. Economically, our country is the strongest its ever been. You have factories moving back into Ohio. You never saw anything like it, right You had your best year. When I say Make America Great Again, what that sort of means is we didnt get there, but we did get there. Now, I have a new theme. Its called Keep America Great. Keep America Great. Now, Im a very loyal person, and I am concerned about changing the theme because Make America Great Again I think was the greatest political campaign in history. I mean, crooked Hillary spent three or four times more money than I have spent. Crooked Hillary, wait, crooked  We should lock her up, Ill tell you. Crooked Hillary spent three or four times more. I wanted to be a little bit  I have to say, that was a great campaign, and I dont want to change it. I dont want to have this incredible 2016, then go with something, and if something ever happened, this country will go to hell, I just  You know the stocks Im talking about, the records. You dont have records this way. You have records. Get used to it, because if that happened, you will see things happen that arent good. But, I have to now say, do I want to change the greatest theme in political history, Make America Great Again, with Keep America Great, right Lets take a little applause, right Well go Make America Great Again, youd clap if you want that. Then we would go, Keep America Great, youd clap if you like that. Okay, are you ready First, Make America Great Again. Ready Keep America Great. You know, that, I call that a free poll. Thats better than a poll. Do you ever see these crazy polls that come out Were doing great in the polls, by the way. Remember, I used to come out and talk about the polls Well start doing that very soon. Were doing great in the polls, but this is like a free poll. Somebody else would go out, they have all this money that they raised, and they give somebody 1 million, and theyll ask 200 people that question. Then, theyll say, Well, Make America Great Again is better, but I will tell you, I havent heard one thing where that was true. With all of these  I would have said, instinctively, Make America Great Again could not be beaten. Ive probably done this 10 times. I have never had it win. Its Keep America Great, and thats what were doing, but were going to use both. Were going to use both  Good. Keep America Great. Were going to use both, but Keep America Great. Thats probably going to be the dominant theme. For eight years, the Obama administration enabled and emboldened-  the Iranian regime. They gave Iran 150 billion, including 1.7 billion-  in hard, cold cash. Can you imagine No, no, can you imagine 1.7 billion, 1.8 billion in cash The foolish Iran nuclear deal financed Iranian aggression while allowing a quick path to nuclear breakout, thats what it did. By the way, it expires so soon. They can have nuclear weapons. Theyre not, as I said before, they will not have nuclear weapons.  They hit us with 16 missiles, and I said, How many We were ready to go. We were ready to go. I said, How many How many died How many were wounded Sir, none. None Pretty good warning system, none. How many were hurt How many were  None, sir. So, we didnt do anything. We were ready. We were ready. Not that I wanted to, but we were ready. You have no idea. A lot of people got very lucky.  We have a lot of your Congressmen right now in Congress. They said, Sir, should we come with you I said, No, stay back and vote. Theyre voting on some pretty important stuff, right But, we were able to get Bill. We thank you, Bill, very much, great job, great warrior. Thank you, Bill. Ohio Lieutenant Governor, Jon Husted. Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Jon. Great job. State Treasurer, Robert Sprague. Thank you, Robert, and you have a lot more money in the bank right now, Robert, as Treasurer, right, than you ever did Ohio Supreme Court Justice, Judy French. Thank you, Judy. Great job. State Senate President, a man highly respected, Larry Obhof. Thank you, Larry. And, a woman who really has become a great friend of mine. She took over this party. We fought like hell. We had some other people that had their mind on taking over the party, but theyd never had a chance against Jane Timken, Jane. And, the man who is in charge of my campaign in Ohio, I had a choice of five people. I said, I like this guys name. I dont know why. His name is Bob Paduchik. Why do I like his name I said Bob, how are we doing He said, Youre going to win big, sir. Because, you know, you keep hearing, you cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio. Thats these guys. Once, I was leading Ohio by a lot in the poll. They never say that anymore. Its terrible. They were saying it when they thought I wasnt going to win, but we were ahead right from the beginning.  I said, Bob, let me ask you, just out of curiosity, I dont have these people. The leaders are not with us. Is that good or bad He said, Sir, its great. You just went up three points, would you believe this, by not having it He said, Dont worry, sir, youre going to win, and we won by a lot. Now, I understand were up by a lot more than we ever thought possible. Bob was fantastic. Thank you, Bob.  Then, one of these characters back there, they put me in a contest with the late great Abraham Lincoln, right Who do you like better, Trump or Abraham Lincoln I said Abraham Lincoln- I said, who do you like better They say they did a poll on this. I think I remember the numbers. All I know is, we won against Abraham, Honest Abe. We won, 53 to 47. Can you believe that, Abraham Lincoln I went back to the First Lady, I said, First Lady, I just beat Abraham Lincoln in a poll. I dont know if they had polls back then, but Abraham Lincoln. I always say I can be more Presidential than any candidate that ever ran, than any President, other than maybe Abraham Lincoln when hes wearing his hat. I like Abe Lincoln, but when were doing well, we have a lot of support. Do you know why Because our country is doing so well. Our country is doing so well. When we went out, we started, and we went right to the top of the polls. It wasnt like these folks today. They are 2%, 3%, but theyre climbing. We went right to the top from day one. We never missed center stage in the debates. Remember those great debates We actually got high ratings. They dont get very good ratings anymore. Theyre like, its like death, watching. I should watch. You know, Im supposed to watch. Its like my job. Try and watch, watch the competition, but its like watching death.  Did you see where Pocahontas is slipping, badly Bernie, Bernie has gone up. Hes surging, Bernies, crazy Bernie, hes surging, and Biden doesnt know the difference between Iran and Iraq. Hes gotten it wrong four times. He goes, When we took our shot at Iraq  No, no, no. Theyre all saying, No, no, theyre screaming, Its Iran, Iran. What His son, right Wheres Hunter, where is Hunter No, I went to one of them. I said, We have to have where is Hunter as a witness. They said, What do you mean, where is Hunter I said, Thats his first name. I have now made his first name Wheres. Wheres Hunter Heres a guy, made no money, got thrown out of the military forces, I think the Navy, got thrown out, had no job, had no nothing, so, he went from that to making millions of dollars a year as soon as Sleepy Joe became Vice President. He made millions of dollars a year. Would anybody in this room do that for millions of  I would. He made millions and millions of dollars a year. Ukraine took care of him. How about China He walked out with 1.5 billion to manage, and he never did it before. He didnt know anything about oil and gas. He was making a fortune. So, where is Hunter Where the hell are you, Hunter Ill tell you, I sort of hope its Joe, because he will hear wheres Hunter every single debate, nine times a debate. Where is Hunter  Howdy Doody. The problem is, a lot of people dont remember Alfred E. Neuman. Dont say that. You look much younger than that, I must say. You have Mayor Pete. I mean, give me a break. Can you believe Mayor Pete This is going to be the President of the United States How would he be against negotiating against President Xi of China We just made one hell of a deal. Youre going to see the numbers very soon, you know One hell of a deal. They didnt like those tariffs. Thanks to Republican leadership, America is winning again, and America, most importantly, is respected again, respected like never before. You know, for years, NATO has taken advantage of the United States. We protect Europe from Russia, and the numbers have been going down for many, many years, 15 years, 18 years. The numbers is like a roller coaster down. I went over, and I said Folks, you got to pay your bills. Youre delinquent. Youre delinquent. Then, they dont like me. They say, We like Obama better. They should like Obama better. Obama would go in and say, Thank you very much for coming. We appreciate it. Bye-bye, Im going back to Washington. Im going back. Ill be violating the carbon footprint. Im going to Hawaii to play golf. I drive to play a round of golf at the course I own, it doesnt even cost them anything. He flies to Hawaii, nobody cares. If I drive 20 minutes, its like, Donald Trump is playing golf today. He violates the carbon footprint, but just think of it. Think of where weve come. Think of where weve come. A great congressman from Tennessee, they have  Its a great state. They have early voting, very early voting, probably the earliest. He said, I dont know. I just left Tennessee. This was in November. This was the election, 2016. He said, I just left this incredible state of mine, and I love that state. Sir, weve seen lines of people that didnt vote before, because they never were inspired to vote, and these are people that never voted. They had hats on, Trump. They have pins, on Trump, Trump, Trump, and Trump. They have the bands on, you know, like a Miss Universe, prom. It says, Trump Pence, and theyve got buttons all over it. Theyve got shirts saying Trump and Trump Pence. I never saw anything like it. If every state is like Tennessee, sir, I hate to tell you, youre going to have one hell of a victory, and thats what happened, right Thats happened. You did it. You did it, and I think were going to have bigger numbers, even bigger numbers, because Ill tell you what, were a long way from the election. I think the crowds today are bigger than they were the day before the election last time. I really do. You know, Elizabeth Warren-  sadly referred to, she of great Indian heritage. Remember, I used to say, I have more Indian blood in me than she has, and I have none. I turned out to be right. You look at what shes doing, you look at what shes saying, the lies, the deceit, the fraud, you see it all. We are going to do so great. Its got to be something thats going to be special. Its going to be for the record books. The Evangelicals called some of the greatest pastors, ministers, preachers, and they just called today, five of the most respected people. They said things that were incredible. They said, Theres never been anything like this in the church that they can  Some of them have been doing it for 30, 40 years. They said, We have never seen enthusiasm like we see for this President and for this Presidency, all of us, like we have right now.  He never said that before. Billy Graham wasnt somebody that would vote and say he voted. Franklin Graham said Billy Graham, maybe the greatest of all, maybe the greatest of all time, he said My father, Billy Graham, who was very old at the time and in trouble, he was in trouble, he was not well, he voted for Donald Trump. What a great tribute that was to me. What a great tribute. Great family. Unemployment has reached the lowest level in over 51 years. African-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American unemployment have all reached the lowest rates ever, ever, ever recorded. Wages are rising fast. Theyre going up very fast, and the biggest percentage increase, makes me happy, are for blue-collar workers. 40 million. Think of this, 40 million American families are now benefiting from the Republican child tax credit, each receiving an average of over 2,200 a year. Now, America lost  This is hard to believe, because you think, How could it possibly be true but this is what happened. Probably, its the number one reason Im running. America lost 60,000 factories under the previous administration, 60,000. You wouldnt believe that its possible, but I know its true, because Ive said it 50 times, and the fakers back there, theyve never corrected me. No, its true. No, its true. If I were slightly off, if it were, if I was off by two factories, thered be a headline, Donald Trump Told a Fib. Donald Trump gets to be a Pinocchio again. No. Think of it, 60,000 factories, plants and factories, closed, closed. They went to Mexico. They went to China. 60,000. Its not even  Take a look at a map and put 60,000 little dots. I mean, you wouldnt believe it could be that many, but it is, its 60,000 closed, gone. Theyre all coming back. Theyre all coming back. Right now, just in a very short period of time, weve added 12,000 brand new factories, and many more are coming in. One of the reasons theyre coming in is weve eliminated a record number of job- killing regulations, saving the average American household 3,000 a year. Total income gains for median households will reach over, ready 10,000 a family. 10,000. Now, under the Bush administration, the 10,000, that includes what weve done in terms of median income. Im adding in there the tax cuts, which are tremendous, 2,400. Im adding the regulation cuts, Im adding the whole package over 10,000. Now, under President Bush, it was 450. Under Barack Hussein Obama, it was 975. Under President Donald J. Trump, its 10,000 in three years, three. In three years. Dont forget, President Bush, eight years, 450. President Obama, eight years, 975. President Trump, three years, not even, not even, not even, but three years, 10,000. Were going up. Were going up.  Clean coal. What they do with coal today is incredible, clean coal. With the help of energy workers right here in Ohio, the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far, number one. We were number one.  You know, theres a state known as Texas, and I won Texas by a lot, just like I won Ohio by a lot. How would you like to go into Texas and say, By the way, we dont want your oil or natural gas anymore How about that Beto Remember he said, I was born to be President. Anybody that says that, I said, Thats the end of his career. Remember, he had the cover of the magazine I wont mention the magazine, sleazebag magazine. He was born to be President, and right after that, he came tumbling down, but hes from Texas, so he was against religion, he was against oil, and he was against guns. Abraham Lincoln could not win in Texas with that platform. Thats not a good platform. Its not a good platform, but you have people that want to shut down the oil industry. If you do that, youre going to shut down half your businesses. Its really more than that, and the rest of them are not going to be able to pay because the cost of this energy would be so expensive. We have all forms of energy. We have every form of energy, and we are doing great, but they want to cripple your states economy. The voters of Ohio will never let that happen, never going to let it happen. Our air and our water right now is cleaner than its been in 40 years. Sadly, I cant say historic because, you know, a couple of hundred years ago, there was nobody here, right I assume that 2, 300 years ago was cleaner, probably. You never know, but our water and our air is as clean as its ever been, and I took us out of that horrible Paris accord. I always say, How are you doing with the Paris accord Dont ask. Saved trillions and trillions of dollars that was put in there to hurt us, in my opinion. It was put in there to hurt us. We were paying money to India. We were paying money to China. Chinas didnt kick in until 2030, we kicked in immediately. We had to pay money. Russia kicked in, in 20  Lets see, they kicked in before. They were 1990, wait, they were 1996. That was a very dirty period of air, so, they didnt have  We kick in now, and that, its just unacceptable. We would have spent trillions and trillions of dollars. We would have had to close up, I think, at least 25% to 30% of our businesses. Who the hell would make a deal like that, right Who would make a deal like that No, how unfair. You look at Russia. You look at China. You look at India. They all got these massive breaks. We got no breaks, and were paying money. I say sometimes to France, How are the yellow vests working out Because they dont like raising their taxes and sending the money to faraway places that theyd never heard of. So, we are in good shape. It took a certain amount of courage to do that. I said Im going to get killed on this one, and you know what I did it, and I was applauded, because the people get it. The people know what were doing, and theyre tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world. Theyre tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world.  I immediately canceled the Obama administrations job-killing catastrophe, which would have dealt a death blow to the United States auto industry, the Transpacific Partnership. It was a disaster. That was going to be worse than NAFTA. NAFTA, I always say, the worlds worst deal. I think that would have been worse. It would have taken the car industry. It would have taken many of your industries. That was a setup for the United States to get fleeced.  Thats going to include, because we take care of our great auto workers of Toledo, the home of Jeep. How good is Jeep Ive taken the toughest-ever action against Chinas chronic trade abuses, including tariffs on 370 billion worth of Chinese made goods, bringing billions and billions of dollars into our treasury. I gave some of that money, because they were targeted, to our farmers, and our farmers did just fine. Now, the deal is done, and the other deals are done, and the farmers are doing very well. We love our farmers, and they never complain. They never complain. You know, when theyd go, the fake news back there, theyd go and theyd talk- And when they come, the fake news back, they go and talk to the farmers. What do you think of President Trump China is deciding not to buy anymore of this. You know what the farmers would say, Were going to have to suffer for a while because theres China and theres other nations have been ripping us off for years. The President is right and were with the President. How great How great But our strong action paid off and well sign that terrific and fully enforceable Phase One trade deal with China. And again, were keeping the tariffs on because we use that for other money. We are taking billions. Remember what I said Were not paying for it. Because China devalued their currency and then they put a lot of money into the pot. Were not paying for it. And now theyre starting to say, I guess he was right. And our trade deficit, as a result, has come, has really come substantially down. It was just in the papers today. The trade deficit has come down. As a result of our actions, steel mills all across Ohio, you know this better than I do, are roaring back to life JSW Steel is investing five hundred million dollars in Acero Junction. Republic Steel is reopening the Loraine Mill that they idled in 2016. Charter Steel is building a 150 million dollar mill in Cuyahoga Heights and Nucor is investing 85 million dollars at a facility in Marion, Ohio. Think of that. I think you do. The steel industry was dead and now its vibrant. All told, American steel companies are currently making 13 billion dollars worth of new investments all across our nation. Think of that. They werent investing 25 cents. The industry was dead. Now its vibrant. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. We are finally putting America first But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Washington Democrats are wasting Americas time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts. Think of it. The day they came down that escalator it started. Who the hell else could they take in this stuff Right Can I get some credit for that Most guys would have been in a corner with their thumb in their mouth saying, Mommy, Mommy, take me home. These are bad people. The Democrat politicians were fighting today are the same ones who took a sledgehammer to Ohio jobs in factories. They destroyed your factories. They destroyed your jobs. But theyre losing and were winning and Americas comeback continues full speed ahead. On no issue have Democrat politicians more clearly betrayed the American people than the issue of illegal immigration. Far left radical politicians support deadly sanctuary cities and demonstrated their contempt, scorn, and disdain for everyday Americans and the American family. These jurisdictions release dangerous violent criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to rob, attack, and kill American citizens but stop it. They want open borders. Can you believe it And because of Democrats open border policies, they want open borders. They want more people flowing. Come on in. Come on in. Innocent Americans are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals. As just one example right here in Ohio, you all know about it, an illegal alien went on a deadly crime spree, attempting to rape a 14-year-old girl. Then raping an murdering a 60-year old woman. Then shooting at a woman who took a shortcut through the park and was walking with her children. And finally the police came. We love our police. And they were able to apprehend this terrible criminal. Thanks to Democrat policies, MS-13 gang members theyre the worst were allowed to infiltrate the country. You know I called them animals and Nancy Pelosi said, Theyre not animals. Theyre human beings. Take a look at whats happened to her district. Her district is one of the most disgusting dirty it used to be one of the best in the country. Now its a disgrace whats happened. Drug dealings all over the place. The homeless theyre not taking care of. Tents down major thoroughfares. What happened in San Francisco, in particular her district, and she lives in this beautiful house. But they turn all these arsonists out, including killing their victims with machetes, MS-13. They kill them with machetes. You know why Because its more painful than using a gun. Federal authorities recently discovered and rounded up more than 25 MS-13 gang members in Central Ohio. And they will be sent to jail or frankly, I they hold them I dont know that they can hold them. Theyre going to be sent the hell back home. Last year alone, ICE officers, who by the way are heroes. These are brave people. I dont want to do it. You dont want to do it. Lets see, you can do it. You can do it. You can do it. Most of you wouldnt. I mean, Ive seen it. They have these people that are like killers. And now the guys are here. And they want to call them a safe place. And they run in and theyre swinging and punching. What the hell kind of a job is that Thats what they do. Theyre tough people. Theyre great patriots. Who the hell wants to do it Theyre incredible, ICE. And they get scorned and we take out thousands and thousands of MS-13 members every single year. They throw them in the back of the van and we get them the hell out of our country. But ICE offices worked through Ohio police to remove one thousand two hundred dangerous criminal aliens from your streets. And on all your street, do you see the difference now between what it is now We have a problem over there Go ahead. Take your time. Take your time. Good, thank you. Great job. Thank you. Okay these people here, unlike you up there, these people have been waiting for three days so that they could be here. I dont know. You know what If I had to wait three days, I think Id like your seat better. I like your seat. But Democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order, and justice. Thats really the way it is. We side with law enforcement, with law abiding Americans, not law breaking criminal aliens. We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members from our country by the thousands. We are sending them home. And we will no let them back in. And I have to tell you, a lot of things are happening. Youre going to hear about that in two seconds. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, illegal crossing are down 75% since May. We have ended catch and release. Catch and release, you know what catch and release is We catch them. We take down their name and we release them. What kind of crap is that These are the policies that we inherited. You catch somebody, take their name. Say Please come back in three years. Right And were releasing them back to the community. And if you dont do that everybody gets sued. Can you believe this We have ended catch and release. The other one, beauty, how about that lottery Its called VISA lottery. How about this They put their hand these people are going to America. Bomb. I will not use names because Ill be accused of something later. But from Honduras, what about it El Salvador, we have Hes good. Only in Ohio can that happen. Whos the man that did that Who is that So anyway, but, in Honduras, Guatemala they have like this lottery. Now the people, Ive gotten to know the government officials. Theyre good. Theyve made some good things. They said, Hey we need to take our people back. Theyre getting their people back. Before, they wouldnt take them back. Theyd send them here to go into our county. Wed bring them back under past administrations and then after that, theyd say, Were not taking them back. Were not taking them back. Take them the hell our of here. Were not letting you land your plane. So we have the government flying the plane all over trying to get a couple prisoners, bad people back. Now they take them back. You know why Because we said, Look, if you dont take them back, were going to put tariffs on every single thing you sell. Now they say, Wed love to take them back. Wed love to take them back. Well take them back gladly, sir. No, they couldnt get them back. Wed take off with these absolutely gang members an wed bring them back and they wouldnt accept them. We couldnt land the plane. We couldnt get anything through the border. It comes through the border this way, not that way. But now they take them back. Theyve been good actually. Theyve been very good. Now we paid them a lot of money. We paid them 500 million dollars a year. Can you believe we paid them 500 million through El Salvador And I said, Oh, theres not going to be any money anymore because youre not treating us right. And theyve been good. Theyve been great. They take them back. How many would you like us to take Well take as many as you want. And heres the big thing. Ready You ready Today in the newspapers in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals we wont the big big beautiful lawsuit when they were all suing us. The wall is being built. We built it. We built already a tremendous amount. But were releasing four million dollars of military construction funds to build the biggest section of the wall. Its literally being signed now and will be under construction very shortly in couple of weeks. And weve already built over a 100 miles of wall. How about that 100 miles. And by the end of next year, were going to have a lo more built. And its already having a big impact. How about that, Democrats Walls dont work. We want technology. I said, What do you want to do They want drones. Oh, good. When people are rushing, the caravans, when theyre rushing, having a drone flying around is not going to help you do it. Okay Nothing like you know five years ago, the Democrats all wanted a wall. They just could never get I built. They didnt know how the hell to build it. I do. So we built 100 miles. I think probably more than that now. We have a lot under contract. But we won our big case just I woke up. They said, Sir, we have good news. They overturned a horrible decision from the lower court. You can now fund the rest of the wall. I said, Thank you very much. Thank you, Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals have changed some. They want crime. They want gangs. Im saying all this stuff and then I say, Gee, now I sort of understand why they hate me. Right But its true. Its true. Their policies are a disaster. Theyre bad politicians and theyre horrible policies but what they do is they stick together and then theyre vicious. Theyre vicious, horrible people. I didnt say that. Theyre horrible people. What they do to people is as disgrace but they stick together left their party and joined our party. But weve done things nobodys ever done before. But the Democrats are taking their cues from socialist Bernie Sanders and that group. Omar, AOC, Talib. This is a jihadist woman, Talib. Talib. Boy, what a group but theyre the leaders of the party. Theyre really my opinion dealers. Thats what happened. Thats how they got into this impeachment on this. The leaders of the party are theres AOC, Talib, and Omar. And Pelosi beats them but she shakes and quivers and shes very soft. But you know who the leader of your party is All of you. You. Youre the leader of your party. Everybody believed me. Then she went down. Then she started coming up and then he went down. It doesnt help me to do it a year-and-a-half before the election. Thats why, like with the Green New Deal, okay I want to say great things about it. Okay I dont want to knock it and then say, Oh, were not going to use that. I like it when they say, You no longer can fly airplanes. No longer can you have any cows in meadows. Right No longer can you do anything. We cant do anything anymore. The Green Deal, I love it. I think its great. It should be debated. It should be debated rally its a month before. Youll get to hear the real facts. But Im tired of talking about this 10 months before the election. They can do more with the tape than they can do with a newspaper. No, theyll do it. Youll see it. Somewhere youll see it, Trump supports his plan. They are sick. Republicans will defend middle class taxpayers and the right to keep the doctor of your choice. We will protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And we will protect your pre-existing physician. Youll have your physician. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb, right up until the moment of birth. That is why I have asked Congress to prohibit late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Radical Democrats now have a party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the party of the American dream. We still have the American dream. Mitch helped a lot. He helped a lot. It wasnt so easy. Mitch McConnell. Were aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and its bad. In 2018, drug overdose deaths in Ohio fell by listen to this 22%. Thats not good enough but credit to opioid. And as we continue rebuilding our military, we have the star legendary Army tank factory in Lima. And weve authorized 441 new striker fighting combat vehicles and 453 new Abrams tanks to be built in the Buckeye State. Thats a lot of tanks. So wait, just a quick story. Okay Im proud of this. So they had this Army tank plant, right, in Lima. And I said Whats going on Theyre closing it. Oh. Theyre closing. Theyre closing everything. When I came they wanted to close everything. So I was president-elect I think right around at that time. And I went to Lima and went through the factory where they make these trucks, the plant. And they make the tanks. They make all of these Army vehicle. And I said, These people are amazing. You could never close this. You could never re-open it again. Theyd been doing this for many many decades and this factory was incredible. And I looked at the tanks they made. Theyre the best in the world by Abrams. Theyre the best in the world. I said, Wait a minute. If you close this, were not going to be where are you going to build tanks This is the primary factory in the whole country. I think it might be the only factory in the whole country. Please send us 200 tanks. We dont want to send you any tanks because were going to kick your ass. Were going to make our own tanks. Right Weve got to make our own tanks. So I did something, based on my instinct because instinct sometimes works better than anything else. Based on my instinct, I said,  You cant close this plant. I went through that plant. I spent two, three hours talking to people who worked there. I looked at some of the hydraulic and Im, I love all in the world, tractors, all of that stuff. I know a lot about it. And I looked at the carvings. I looked at the metal. I looked at how perfect everything was that turns around. How perfect it fit. They put it on and it would fit like within 1/100th of an inch. And I said, Youre not going to be able to do this anyplace else. I said, And were going to be expanding our military. Were going to be rebuilding. Who the hells going to make our tanks if you close I said, Keep it open. I actually, it was all closed. Is there anybody from Lima Is that a true story Right It was closed. They announced it was closed. It was all set to close. I said, You cant close this plant. And now look, the numbers I just gave you. Were making almost 500 new tanks. You couldve never reopened a place like that. Its incredible. And you couldve never gotten those workers. Theyre really skilled people and if you did it would cost you billions and billions of dollars to do it. It wouldnt have been as good as we have. So that was something I did that Im very proud of because I really over-rode a lot of talented people that wanted it to close. I recognized Israels true capitol and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And we further recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, 52 years. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Ohio. And saying our present battle is the survival of the American nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, and fought so hard to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020. We have to win. You know, we have to win. Because all of these things that weve done can be undone. And you can have a country that goes to hell very very fast, very very fast. Only in this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. And I have seen that dirty rotten swamp better than anybody else in America. A lot of crooked people, disgusting crooked people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the U.S.A. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. Nobody knew that. It couldve been done long before I got here. They had the technology. But were ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years. Isnt that amazing Whoever thought that was possible Who would have thought thats possible We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one big beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of generations of Ohio patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. From Cleveland to Cincinnati, from Dublin to Dayton, and from Columbus to Toledo, this state is the home of proud families and farmers, and miners, and manufacturers, and aviators, and astronauts. Ohio is where the Wright Brothers invented the airplane and where Annie Oakley got her gun. Ohio is the state that gave us American legends and American heroes like Thomas Edison, Neil Armstrong, and the great John Glenn. Ohio is the place where strong American workers mined coal, worked the railroads, and forged the steel that made America into the greatest most powerful nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Ohio, the best is yet to come. Because together, we will make American wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Toledo. Thank you."
Cincinnati,Aug1,2019,"Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you to Vice President Mike Pence, and hello Cincinnati. You know, I used to work in Cincinnati, a place called Swifton Village. You know what that is Swifton Village It was good and it worked out well, and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age, and look what happened to all of us, right Look what happened. Look what happened. I was watching the so-called debate last night, and I also watched the night before that was long, long television. The Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically. This morning, thats all the fake news was talking about. Its all they were talking about. That wasnt pretty. No, were doing good. Its great to be back in the state that I love. I love this state. Very special. Very, very special, on the banks of the beautiful Ohio River with the hardworking patriots of the American heartland. Thank you, Ohio. We love you, Ohio. Weve got thousands of people standing outside, and I asked the officials can we sneak some up along the aisles Can they sit on the stairs But Ill tell you what, this is some crowd, some turnout. Weve sold tens of thousands of tickets. And, you know what the sale price is We keep it nice and low. We keep it nice and low. But, there never has been a movement like this. This is a movement the likes of which theyve never seen before, maybe anywhere, but certainly in this country. Theyve never seen anything like this before. You came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers, and you came for  I mean, look, from wherever you came from. There were a lot of you. And, they showed up on election day. Ill never forget, a wonderful congressman from Tennessee. They have early voting, and one of the earliest places, great state, Tennessee, and he was in Pennsylvania with me, great state. And he said, You know, sir, Ive been doing this for a long time, but Ive never seen people like this show up for early voting. People that havent voted in a long time because they didnt see anybody they wanted to vote for. He said, Ive never seen it. They have Trump banners, and Trump hats, and Trump buttons. Ive never seen it. This great congressman said, I dont know, sir, but I can tell you one thing. If the rest of the country is voting like Tennessee is voting, youre going to win by a lot. And, we won, and we won by a lot. We won by a lot. Our nation is stronger today than ever before. The number one economy on earth. No economy is so strong. Were rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military, and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history, and when we took over, it was depleted. We took over a depleted military. Its not depleted anymore, I can tell you that. Our spirit is strong. Our stride is back and our stand is clear. We are finally putting America first. Its about time. Weve created six million new jobs since election day. Nobody wouldve thought that was possible. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps, and theyre happy. Theyre happy. 123,000 more Ohio workers are employed today than when I was elected. Think of that number. And, right now, Ohio is the most successful its ever been in the history of our country. Thank you. Congratulations, Ohio. Stand up, Mike. And, you have a good governor. I want to tell you that. Good job. Mike. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded. While Republicans are working every day to build up our country, the rage-filled Democrat Party is trying to tear America apart. The Democrat Party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear. No one has paid a higher price for the far lefts destructive agenda than Americans living in our nations inner cities. They have paid a dear price. Do you see whats happening You see our inner cities, we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years, and its stolen money and its wasted money and its a shame. For decades, these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians, and its been total one party control of the inner cities. For a hundred years, its been one party control and look at them. We can name one after another, but I wont do that because I dont want to be controversial. We want no controversy. No controversy. The democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay. Total decay. The Democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence. Theyve squeezed the blood out of them. Left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice, trapping children and failing in government schools left and right. So many of these mayors right now, you know where they are Theyre in jail, thats where they are. Republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice, but the greatest betrayal committed by the Democrats is their support for open borders. These open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals, drain public services, and flood communities with poisonous drugs. Its tough enough, and I want to thank, by the way, the country of Mexico. Theyve got 21,000 soldiers on the border right now. Im starting to like Mexico a lot. They do a lot more for us than the Democrats do, right A lot more, a lot more. And, the numbers are way down. Youll see that. Way, way down. Democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents. They put foreign citizens before American citizens. Were not going to do that. 572 people were murdered in Chicago last year. So, you got a lot of hot people outside, but we broke the all time record. The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala. I believe its higher than  Give me a place that you think is pretty bad. Give me a place. The guy says Afghanistan. I believe its higher than Afghanistan in our country. Think of that. I believe, well check the numbers and if were wrong, they will tell us tomorrow. Itll be headlines. Trump exaggerated. I do believe the rate is higher than Afghanistan, yet Democrats, and theyve run it for many years, want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities. No good, no good. The conditions in Nancy Pelosis once great city of San Francisco are deplorable. Theyre deplorable. Do you remember the word deplorable Do you remember when Hillary used the deplorable She used two words. She used deplorable and irredeemable, right And only being a politician for a few years. I said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable, but it turned out to be deplorable. Deplorable was not a good day for Hillary. Crooked Hillary. She is a crooked one Shes crooked. She is crooked. Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California. What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. Its a shame the world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles, with the tents and the horrible, horrible, disgusting conditions. Look at San Francisco. Look at some of your other cities, and then you have a governor  You have a governor that invites the whole world to come into California. Well pay for your healthcare. Then you wonder why so many people are coming up. Theyre coming up because were the hottest economic country in the world, but theyre also coming up because you have people like that governor say, Come on up. Well give you healthcare. Come. Who wouldnt come up Who wouldnt come up How crazy is this How crazy is this Schools, healthcare. Today, Ive a simple proposal for Democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration, and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities. Thats the way we should be doing it. Thats what we should be doing. By the way, you know, they keep talking about,  Oh, the voters, the voters, the voters. They want all sorts of security. What about a thing called voter ID Voter identification Rob Portman, please work on that, Rob Portman. You have a great senator. Would you please start working on that You see the response. Every place I go, Rob. Please, Rob. Voter ID. They give you everything they can give you except voter ID and the things that matter. Republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first. Our pledge to Americas workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 millions Americans for the jobs of tomorrow. You know whos working very hard on that You probably never heard of her. Ivanka Trump. Shes working very hard. She gave up a lot. She had a very easy life, but she loves doing it. Shes got over, I think, now 12 million people. Theyre teaching them the great companies of our country, theyre teaching people how to do it, and its an incredible thing to watch. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody couldve passed except us. President Obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldnt get it passed. I got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives, and a lot of help. And, the biggest beneficiary is the African-American community. Biggest beneficiary. And, something which a lot of people dont talk about, but we doubled the child tax credit. Doubled it. Our tax plan also created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones, hottest thing going, providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities. Left together, I put out a six minute video detailing everything I found unacceptable about liberalism and the Democrat Party. Take your time. Take your time. Walk away. Doctor Doctor in the house, please Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Dont forget, its a hundred degrees in here. That persons been standing there for almost a day if you think about it. A lot of you, so I appreciate it. And you know what Theyll come back. Theyll get a little something and theyll come right back because theres never been anything like this. Theres never been anything, right Never been. Thank you. Incredible. We established more than 300 opportunity zones in Ohio alone, and these are really working out incredibly well. Nationwide, nearly eight million African-Americans live in opportunity zones, but every democrat voted against them. Every single democrat, because they vote as a block. Its the only thing they do good. They stick together. Their policies, no good. Theyre lousy politicians, but they stick together like glue. Its the only thing they have. Thats the only thing they have going. Democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves. Republicans deliver jobs, safety and opportunity for all Americans. Were thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and well start off with a man who had a very, very tough race for governor. A lot of people choke. They choke like dogs. They cant breathe, aw. They cant breathe. This guy was running against a so-called star  So, thats two protestors, and tomorrow night the headline will be, Protesters, Protesters. You know what happened to the second one He looked at the guy in front of him and he said, Ah, Im out of here. Bye. Thats the way it works, thats the way it works, I guess. Too bad. But, a man who really has done a fantastic job, he campaigned so hard, and this was a star right from the fields of the great Pocahontas whose now lying and cheating her way to the presidency, if possible. Shes trying to win, remember She defrauded people with her credentials. She said she was Indian, and I said that I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none. Im sorry. We drove her crazy. And, we drove her crazy. Thats a good thing, not a bad thing. She went out and she had a blood test done, and it came out 1,024th. He said,  Somewhere back there, hundreds of years ago, there may have been an Indian. Or it may have been a statistical error because it was so small. Which, it was. Anyway, but the guy was from her group. You wouldnt be very happy right now, and we have a man that campaigned so hard, relentless. I came in, we did a rally where we had people like this. It was packed the day before the election and Mike DeWine won that election. -and Mike Dewine won that election and he won it easily. Mike Dewine. We have a man whos running for governor of Kentucky again. And hes done an incredible job. And did you ever hear, sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it But they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct. But when you correct it, you make yourself a little bit less popular. But he had no choice and they had no choice. Its a great, great state and he has turned out to be a great, great governor. Matt Bevin. Hes running in November, and because I like him so much, Matt get a nice big arena ready, were going to do a rally for you. And a man whos fantastic son is here tonight who I just met, incredible. When I ran with him, he was down. I said, Rob Portmans down, and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points. I said, What the Hell did you do And you know what he did He does a great job. Thats what he did. Senator Rob Portman. Great guy. And we have a few guys that, these are warriors. A couple of them you saw the other day, they were questioning Bob Mueller. That was a beauty. He was sharp, wasnt heHe was sharp as a tack and Steve Chabot and Brad Wenstrup, and Warren Davidson and Andy Barr and a man named Greg Pence who happens to be a brother of somebody I know very well. They have been with us through thick and thin, and it has been mostly really good times because what weve done, no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done. Thank you fellas. Great job. A couple of them gave a grilling. They gave a grilling. All they had to do is mention the facts and it was over. And also the auditor of the great state of Ohio, a man whose job I made much easier because you have money pouring in. You have companies pouring in. Keith Faber. How is it Keith The numbers are good, Keith. Numbers are good, right Yeah. The numbers are good. Ohio Senate President, Larry Obhof. Larry, thank you. Great job. Nice tie. I like Larrys tie. And you have a couple of people that are very, very powerful. I hear that office and I shudder, Ohio Supreme Court justices, Sharon Kennedy and Judy French. Thank you. Please dont recuse yourself because I gave you a nice welcome, should I ever be before you. I love judges. When they see you for about two seconds and then you say, oh, that judge should be fair. And then they say, Id like to recuse myself because 29 years ago I met Donald Trump. Id never have been in Weve been doing very well in the courts, by the way. Have you seen Weve been winning a lot of cases, a lot of cases. We really have.  179. Percentage wise, its the second most. We will never be number one. Sadly well never be number one. So percentage wise, nobodys ever seen anything like it. And thats because President Obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in, which is a shame. And I came in, I had 148 openings. Youre supposed to have none. I said, How many do we have 148. And I said, You got to be kidding. And weve all done a good job together. Its been amazing, with Mitch and you and everybody. Its been amazing. So were going to be up to, within two months, 179 federal judges. Thats in two and a half years. And what else Two great Supreme Court judges. Great ones. Theres only one person. I think most of you must know this. Who percentage wise has done better than me with judges Tell me. Ill give you a hint He appointed 100% of the federal judges and 100% of the United States Supreme Court. George Washington. Thats one record were not going to beat. But I appointed many more than him, so lets take it that way. Many anymore. I also want to introduce a friend of mine whos done an incredible job. Shes really something, she has been incredible as a leader of the GOP. Shes the chair and shes my friend Jane Timken. And aman Bob Paduchik. You know Bob Paduchik So Bob, I had to pick campaign manager in Ohio and I kept hearing from the media, You must win the state of Ohio. I heard this over and over for like a year and a half. You must win Ohio. You must win. So I had to pick a campaign manager and I picked a man named Bob Paduchik. And no matter what happened, no matter how badly we were doing, he said, Sir, youre going to win Ohio easily. I said, But Bob, we just lost the head of the GOP in Ohio. He left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave. Great support from the governor, a different governor than Mike by the way, slightly. So he had to get out. So I said, We just lost. And Bob said, Dont worry about it, sir. Youre going to win. In fact, I think you just went up. Then we lost a couple of other people. Id call him. I say, Bob, Im worried about Ohio. Very worried. He said, Dont worry about it, sir. I think he just went up. He kept saying, You just went up. I said to somebody, I dont know much about this guy, but boy, hes the most optimistic person Ive ever met. True. He said, Dont worry. We ended up winning Ohio by close to nine points, which is unheard of. He was right. Bob Paduchik. Bob. And also here tonight, I dont know, did he do a good job My son, Donald Jr. and Kimberly. I hope he did a good job. Good, I heard you did. I heard you did a great job. Hes been a great help. They both have. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kimberly. Thank you very much. Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs, pro family pro growth and 100% pro American. Weve eliminated a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household 3,000 more to spend every single year. The previous administration tried to shut down American energy and close up, totally, close it up. American clean, beautiful coal. Thats what they did. That didnt work out too well, but you had a suffer. It didnt work out well, but get a suffer for a long time until I came along. Youre not suffering any longer. The previous administration, they liked to windmills. If a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless. They make noise, theyre intermittent. They kill your birds. They break down all the time. You have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out, and they cost a fortune and they need subsidy. Other than that, theyre quite good. You dont want one of those windmills within vision. You hear them, theyre noisy. Theyve got a lot of problems. No, were going to say with the great energy thats powering our businesses, thats creating so many jobs. And solar, you know what Well live with solar, but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need. But were going to stay the way we have it. Weve ended the war on American energy and were putting our coal miners back to work and our steelworkers back to work, and our auto companies back to work. Weve learned over the last three years the incredible gold that were sitting on top of in this country. Were very lucky. Were now the largest energy producer in the entire world, bigger than Soviet Union, formerly. Remember the Soviet Union when it was all together. The Soviet Union, when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves Russia. When it was all together, they wanted to be, that was always their dream to be the biggest in the world. Then it became Russia and you know what Theyve done a good job with energy and so has Saudi Arabia done a good job with energy. But were now bigger than Russia. We are now bigger than Saudi Arabia by far. I withdraw our country from the job killing and very expensive Paris Climate Accord. Last year coal export were up 92% compared to 2016. 92%, do you believe that Youre shipping it all over the world. To Vietnam. I was in Vietnam and they said, We get coal from Ohio. We get coal from West Virginia. Its the finest coal in the world. Weve created more than 110,000 new mining jobs, and thanks to states like Ohio the United States is now the number one producer of oil, the number one producer of natural gas, the number one everything having to do with energy. Number one. Anywhere in the world. Were reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that led other countries to pillage our jobs, plunder our factories, and devastate Ohio communities and communities in every state. The era of economic surrender is over, and when you look at what theyve done to your jobs over a period of time, NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worst deal. You still have empty buildings, empty factories, but now theyre getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones. We have hundreds of new companies pouring into the United States. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from one of the last administrations worst sellouts. It would have destroyed our automobile industry. It would have destroyed manufacturing in this country, and maybe thats what President Obama meant when he said, you cant produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the United States, because he wouldve signed Trans Pacific Partnership and he wouldve been right. I killed it. And by the way, TPP, Trans Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already. Already the shipped down 30% of your jobs to Mexico. Under the new USMCA. Thats Mexico and Canada. Weve got to get them to vote on that because thats an incredible deal. But under the new Its going to be very hard for companies to leave you, to fire you, to go down to make their product, whatever it may be, to send it back into the United States with no tax. All we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings. So they got to vote, on the USMCA. Before I took office, foreign countries ripped us off, robbed us blind, and pushed us around, but America is not being pushed around anymore. Do you realize that I got that from working in Ohio for two summers. Weve taken the toughest ever action to stand up to Chinas trade abuse, and I just announced another 10% tariff on 300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country. And thats on top of the 25% that we take off 250 billion coming in from China, and dont let them tell you, the fact is China devalues their currency. They pour money into their system, they pour it in, and because they do that, youre not paying for those tariffs. Chinas paying for those tariffs. For the last 20 years, Chinas taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country, and now were stopping the theft of American jobs. Were stopping the theft of so many other things happening, including intellectual property. They steal our intellectual property. I think they want to try and make a deal with us, but Im not sure, because the word is, I feel they want to wait until they get Theyre praying. Theyre praying. They would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the United States like theyve been doing for the last 25 years. Would love to see a guy like sleepy Joe Biden who has no clue what the hell hes doing. They say to sleepy Joe. Sir, Just sign right there. Oh, okay. Ill sign. Well be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. It has to stop but they understand that. President Xi is good man. Hes a friend of mine. He understands it. And until such time as there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China. Thats all there.  make your product in America. Come on back to the United States. Come on back to Ohio. Theres no tariff. Theres no tariff. Thanks to steel tariffs, hundreds of thousands of tons, think of this, were dumped on our shores, and steel is like something else. Its that quality. They were dumping garbage, they call it sand steel, they call it dirt steel.. It was mixed up. It was bad stuff and we didnt want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building. But they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel, and what was happening is United States steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and I stopped it. I put on a 25% tariff, billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back. Right here in Ohio. Nucor a great steel company, and a steel company thats doing great again, Nucor, has announced an 85 million upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced plans to build a new 150 million steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights, and Cleveland Cliffs announced a new 700 million plant in a very good place that I like a lot, Toledo. Toledo, Ohio. This was unthinkable because four years ago, steel plans were closing. They werent expanding or they werent building. Were building new plants in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, all over. Not Just Ohio. On issue after issue, Democrats have forgotten who it is that theyre supposed to represent. They forgot. I wonder why they forgot. The job of elected officials is to represent American citizens, the radical Democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets. Sanctuary cities. Many of the places that have sanctuary cities and many of the people that live there, they dont want them. They dont want them. Theyre dangerous and not good. Here are just a few examples. In San Francisco, an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft. Yet each time San Francisco defied federal authorities and set him free and bad things happened when they set him free. A sanctuary jurisdiction in California recently released a criminal alien from jail. The very next month, the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe, a horrible thing happened. But yet again, he was released back into your community. After sanctuary city in New Jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence, he was arrested in Missouri for the murders of three people. In the bizarre worldview of the third and hard left, they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent Americans for a single politically incorrect thought. But they want to virtually, and you know this, they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder. Horrible crimes and murder. Republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And yes just won a big lawsuit last week. In fact, on of my lawyers for winning that lawsuit is here tonight. I gave him a little reprieve. We need a lot of lawyers in the White House. We get sued so much, so unfairly, but were winning those lawsuits left and right, but one of them is here. He said, Id love to go to a rally. I said,  Im going to a place called Cincinnati, Ohio. You deserve it. We just won the lawsuit on the wall. Wheres Pat We just won the lawsuit on the wall. You hear that Were building the wall faster and better than ever. Its time for Democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch and release. You know what you do You catch them and then you release them and you say, Would you please report back in four years from now. But only 2% come back. You know why Because theyre not the smartest. They are not the smartest. Theyre the ones we dont want to have come back. Only 2% show up. Catch and release, we could end it immediately if the Democrats caved. So what were doing is something else. Were keeping them out altogether. Were replacing random migraines and were replacing the lottery system. How about the lottery system How about lotteries This was chuck Schumer. You put the name in a basket. The country puts the name in a basket and you picked people out of the lottery. Well, lets see. This ones a murderer. This one robbed four banks. This one, I better not say. This one, another murder. Ladies and gentlemen, another murderer. Think of this. Do you think theyre going to put great citizens they have great citizens, they have great people like we have great people. Do you think those people are going into a lottery No. And then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country. The country isnt based on that, the country, you just take a look, look at the people they put into these lotteries. Its a disgrace. And how weve done this for so many years folks, how weve done this. Its an immigration system thats totally broken and were going to win the House, were going to win the Senate, were going to win the presidency and were going to do a merit based immigration system. Merit based. Merit based immigration. And we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers. We need good people. Were down to 3.5% unemployment. We need people, but we want people to come in based on merit, not based on some lottery put in by a governor. Democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private- Dream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private healthcare and force everyone onto the government plan. Remember the lies from the previous administration. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. 28 time, one lie after another. 28 times it was said and it turned out to be a total lie. My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you. Were offering right now plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. Always. Always. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. And then youll have like a governor of Virginia, its not only late term abortion, its killing the baby after the baby is born. How about that Think of that. Think of that. Thats why Ive asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and theyre the party, frankly, of socialism. The Republican Party is the party of freedom. Were the party of the American worker, the American family. Were the party of the American dream. Im fighting for you each and every day. I had a great life. I used to get great publicity. Nobody got better I had such a great life. It was so easy. My great wife, the first lady, Melania, she said, You know, youve always been a hard worker. You love to work, but your life was a lot easier in the old days. But I love it and you know why I love it Because were accomplishing so much. Nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things were doing. Even a thing like Right to Try, right Right to Try. Theyve been trying to get that for years and years and years. Thats people that are really sick, terminally ill. They couldnt get medicine. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest clinics, the greatest technicians in the world. They couldnt get anything. Theyd traveled to Asia if they had money. They traveled to Europe. Theyd travel all over the world hoping for a cure. If they had no money theyd just go home. Theyd die. They had no hope. For 44 years, theyve been trying to get Right to Try. We are so advanced in medicine. We have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work, but we werent allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick. You know why Because they didnt want this drug if it didnt work to hurt the people, but the people were terminally ill. So I got it approved and it wasnt easy. It was complicated. The insurance companies didnt want to do it. The government didnt want to do it. The doctors didnt want to do it. Tremendous liability. But our country didnt want to do it. They said, Well, if it doesnt work, were going to get sued. I say, So theyll sign an agreement, very strong, one page, taking all liability away from the United States, from the drug companies, from the doctors, all liability. Theyre terminally ill. Lets try it. And you know what Its been a miracle. So many people have done so well. Its great. We got it done. When I set about the agreement, they had these great lawyers and they said, Gee, thats a good idea. Theyd been working in this few years. They said, Thats a good idea. I said, Yeah, its a good idea. How about getting you to me like in about two hours Right to Try. Its a great thing. But we have so many things like that. I have lists that you wouldnt even believe. I have lists that go on for pages of things weve done. Weve launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries. Its a very unfair system. Our country pays the highest prices in the world. Last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down. Now were going to bring it down by a lot. Were going to bring it down a lot. And now So other countries Heres an example, Canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs that we do. So we have a great governor in the state of Florida, Ron DeSantis, calls me up. Doing a great job. Ron DeSantis. He was at three and he went to 70. thats a pretty good increase, right Ron DeSantis, a great governor. And he comes to me, he goes, You know, if you buy the drugs, if we buy the drugs, because this is so botched up, we have a middleman. Its not a good situation. He said, If I could go and buy the drugs from Canada, I could save 50%. I said, Do it. Do it. And if you can buy them from Europe, because their system Like, remember I used to scream when I was winning states and not getting the delegates that I was entitled to and Id say the system is rigged Well, the drug system is rigged. Its rigged. So if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from Europe or from Canada or from other places at a big deep discount, were doing it and were giving them the right to do it. Just happened today. And were doing one other thing that, believe it or not is even bigger, but youll be seeing that over the next two weeks. With the help of your great Senator, Rob Portman, weve taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in Ohio, drug overdose deaths went down 22% last year, 22%. No, but think of that. Opioid, big problem, big problem. Deaths went down. Opioid deaths, 22%. Nobody writes that. Nobody talks about that. They dont want to talk about that. Good job, Rob. Good job. Good job, Mike. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. They been trying to pass VA Choice for four decades. They couldnt get it done. We got it done. We got it done. This is where a veteran would stand online for three, four, five, six days, for three weeks, for five weeks. Sometimes theyre okay. By the time they see a doctor, theyre terminally ill. And I said, You know, I have a great idea. Because I not been doing that this long. You know, weve been working with this for Ive been thinking about it a lot. This was during the campaign. What a campaign that was, right Was that a campaign or what And I came back to my people. I had experts and I said, I have a great idea. These lines for the veterans are too long. It takes them three, four weeks sometimes to see a doctor. I have a great idea. Lets let them go outside. Go to a private doctor. Well pay the bill. Theyll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately. Well pay the bill. And I thought I said, Man, am I smart I am the smartest guy to think of that. So I went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and I said, How do you like that idea And they said, Sir, weve known about it for about 40 years, but weve never been I said, Really Youve known about it that long But heres the thing. We got it done. Nobody else could get it done. Nobody else. And Accountability. You couldnt fire anybody. If they were treating our vets badly, you couldnt fire them for anything. People could steal. They could be sadistic to our vets. By the way, they wouldnt have done that in primetime to our vets. I can tell you that. They can be whatever they want. You couldnt fire them. And it was because of unions and it was because of other things. Civil Service. Very tough. You couldnt fire anybody for almost anything. We had cases where people got They got caught stealing a lot of money and you couldnt fire them. We got VA Accountability. Now we say, Jim, get the hell out of here. Youre fired. Were rebuilding our military. And after years of budget cuts and layoffs, the army tank plant in Do you Lima You call it Lima, right See You know, most people call it Lima, but I know Lima. But you know why Because I came here and they said, Were closing this plant. I said, What kind of a plant is it Remember when I was here In Lima. And I used to say, You mean Lima They said, No, sir. Its Lima. Thats why Because, but Leah, hey look, Ill be honest with you because they have it wrong with the teleprompter, okay And I would have been in big trouble. But the good news is I dont use the teleprompter too much. If I did, you wouldve been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal. But in Lima, and I said, What kind of a plant And I said, Lets go see it. During the campaign I went to see it and they make the incredible, the best army tank in the world and I couldnt believe the complexity, the genius. I said, Wait a minute. You close this, youll never be able to open it again. You cant open this. This isnt like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof. This is complicated. This is genius and youll never replace these men and women that work here. I said And I didnt know anything at the time other than I said, Youre not closing it. They took it off to list. They kept it open and now were making army tanks around the clock. Were investing in the future of human space flight. Americans won the race to the moon and we will now win the race to Mars. Its going to be amazing. And you know, one thing I have to say also, and were also winning the race to great, great strategic defense and offense, not just Mars. And Mike Pence is doing a great job on that. Great job. To protect Americas security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal, a horrible, stupid deal. We gave Iran 150 billion. We gave Iran  1.8 billion in cash. Plane loads of cash. I wonder what they saw when those planes landed. I wonder what happened to the cash Can you believe it One 1.8 billion we gave them in cash. And remember what I said, Iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago. When I took over, Iran was all over. They had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction. They were all over. And now they just want to They want a negotiated deal so badly. Iran. Iran. I recognized Israels true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And just a few months ago, we recognized the Golan Heights. You know that. Thats another one. Big one for the security of Israel. Also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuelan and we condemn any of the socialist brutality taking place. Lets see what happens there. Lets see what happens. Tonight we renew our resolves that America will never be a socialist country. Never, ever, ever will it be a socialist country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of our great, our beautiful, our wonderful American dream. Were not going to let our country ever go down the route of socialism. You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing. Its about you. I say it again. I say it all the time. Never happened before. Theres never been a movement like this. Theyve had movements. They never went They won a state. They did well in the state. We won 32 states. Theres never been anything like it. Theres never been anything like it. But this movement is about your family and your future, and its about the life and the fate of your country. We begin our Hey, look, this is a good place. Is this a great thing to do We begin our campaign and were going to do great, Bob. Right, Bob Bob, if we dont do great, youre fired, Bob. Youre fired. But think of it, our Ohio campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nations future. And again, remember this, Ohio is doing better today than its ever, ever, ever done before. Its the best its ever done. Whats going to do A guy like a sleepy Joe Biden is going to come in and say, But I could do better. I could do better. He wants to go back to sleep. Together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can reach their fullest and highest potential, tremendous potential. Our country has such tremendous potential. You know, weve had The last week, weve had the highest stock market in the history of our country. That means 401ks. That means job. But theres tremendous potential to go up. We have tremendous potential to go up. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words Made in the USA or Made in America. Either one. You can use either one. Made in America, made in the US. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine and I see what theyre doing. I see it. They show me the things were doing in our country today. Theres never been anything like it. We will be ending the AIDS epidemic shortly in America and curing childhood cancer very shortly. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Just remember with the Democrats, there is no second amendment. You can forget about keep and bear arms. You can forget it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We will never ever stop fighting. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the sanctity of life. And we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always be proud, patriotic Americans. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, In God We trust. Two days ago, I spoke at the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislature assembly at Jamestown, Virginia. It was beautiful. It was incredible. I was I must tell you, I was reminded of so many great things in our country. We have been blessed with such a remarkable and priceless heritage. We are the greatest republic on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way. Every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. The future belongs to the greatest movement in the history of our country. And with your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one people in one family saluting one great American flag. We all share the same home. We all share the same heart. And we all share the same love of Almighty God. Together, with the great and proud people of Ohio, we are making America wealthy again. We are making America strong again. We are making America safe again. We are making America great again and with your vote in 2020 we will keep America great. Thank you, Ohio. Thank you."
Lexington,Nov4,2019,"Thank you very much and thank you to the original Lee Greenwood. Thank you. Thank you, Lee. Great guy. Well, I just want to say a very big hello, Kentucky Great place. Its great to be here in the home of a group called the Wildcats. You ever hear the Kentucky Wildcats By the way, they play at a very big arena. This place. Look at this. Hello, up there This is incredible. With thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving American patriots, which is what you are. What you are. Tomorrow, the people of Kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific Republican governor, Matt Bevin. Hes done a fantastic job. Hes done a fantastic job. And were sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country, to the rest of the world, that the republican party, you know what we stand for. But you see whats happening with the Democrats, they have gone crazy. The do nothing Democrats, and theyre not getting it done. Under Republican leadership, the economy is booming, wages are rising, confidence is soaring. Kentucky is thriving like never ever before, and America is stronger than ever before. True. Kentuckys unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country. Thats not bad. And I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives, and the job that Matt Bevin has done as governor, hes had to do some things that you had to do. And hes done unbelievably well. It sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future. You had to do it. So I just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do. You have the best numbers youve ever had in the history of the state. And with the help of your Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written. Were supporting our police, were rebuilding our military, were defeating radical Islamic terrorists like never before. The monsters animal known as Al-Baghdadi is dead. And the man that took his place is dead also. American Special Forces gave the worlds number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell. No enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the United States military, which is now stronger than ever before. Weve rebuilt it and it was all made in America. All made in America. And our country is winning again, and our country is highly respected again. But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the radical democrats are going totally insane. They want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out faith from the public square, and you know this, silence you online, confiscate your guns. You better be careful. The Second Amendment very, very important, very precious. They are after your Second Amendment. With us, nobodys touching our Second Amendment. And that includes the gentleman thats running against Matt. Theyre after your Second Amendment. We cant let that happen. They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this, destroy anyone who calls traditional America American values. All you have to do is ask the boys from Covington Catholic High School. Some of whom are here tonight. The far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation, telling you what to think, what to believe and how you should live. They want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes. They want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but Kentucky will never be broken. Kentucky cant be broken. Youre too strong and youre too smart. In their craze thirst for power, the democrats are trying to tear our country apart. First, Democrats engineer the Russia hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the American people, the Russian hoax. Then they did the Mueller scam. You remember that The Mueller scam. Two years and they said nothing. And then Mr. Mueller testified. That was a wonderful day for me. You remember last week. I dont know Tulsi Gabbard, but Hillary Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent. I dont know Jill Stein. Shes a Greenie and thats fine. Shes a Greenie, Jill Stein. But Jill Stein was an agent of Russia also. These people are crazy. Now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, they are corrupt. And Nancy, unlike Kentucky, which is doing great, Nancy ought stop wasting time, go back to her district in San Francisco, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system. Whats happened is San Francisco and whats happened to so many other places run by the radical left Democrats, its unbelievable. Los Angeles. You take a look at Los Angeles, looks like a third world city. But go back to Nancys area, look at whats happened. Theres been no place in the country thats gone down like the area that Nancy Pelosi represents. And shes wasting all of her time. And you know what, its backfiring. You see it. But the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation, with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt. Impeachment. Think of it. So today, we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market. Now, thats hundreds of days. So last week, think of this, in the history of our country, its never done better. And by the way, thats not rich, thats not poor, thats for everybody. Your 401s, how you are doing Pretty good, right Pretty good. People tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, theyve been running the 401s for years. And they totally lost respect for lets say, the husband, totally lost respect. Now they think hes a financial genius because hes up 74%. She says, darling, I love you. You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind. And you know what, if the Democrats get in, thats not going down by 50%, thats going down to nothing. Its going to be worthless. Its going to be worthless. Youll have a depression the likes of which youve never seen. Mark my words. But hopefully, we dont have to even think about it. And that was going to happen here. When we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction. And dont forget, that was zero interest. Were paying interest. In other words, people are now getting interest in their money. But that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest. Last week, the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of Americans. To be exact 63 million people, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. Theyve been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won. And actually, before we won, they were plotting to overthrow this election. Before we won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, that disgusting Washington Post, look at all these people back there, look. Fake news media. Its the fake news. Look at all of them. What they dont know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years, or 13 years, or maybe 17 years, or maybe if I still have the strength, 21 years. See, now theyre going crazy. Now theyre saying, see, I told you, he was a dictator. He wants to take charge in control of our country. These people are crazy said. The guy goes, well, were going to fight and were going to  No, no. Hes going to win. You know hes never leaving office, dont you Hes never going to leave office. These people are crazy. Theyre crazy. But that disgusting newspaper thats right there, The Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun. All right, you can get them out. Be gentle, be gentle. Be very gentle. You know every time I say, get them out of here, I end up getting sued. They say, he hurt my arm. All right. So be very gentle, please. I dont want to get sued. Be very gentle. Very, very gentle. Hes going home to mom. Thank you. By the way, do we love our law enforcement And in the whole world, even on a Monday Night, I like the Monday Nights because I think were 58 and 0, thats a good record. Even for the Wildcats, thats a good. Were 58 and 0, but even on a Monday Night, is there anything cooler than being at a Trump rally Nothing can. With last weeks vote, the far left has declared war on American democracy itself. These people are lunatics. In the face of these attacks, Republicans are the most unified that Ive ever seen, and Ive been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time. And the democrats have never witnessed anything like it, and they know theyre not going to win in 2020. So lets see what can we do to win, but thats not working too well. Youll see. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, slander. The Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon. Tomorrow, Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message. You will vote to reject Democrats extremism, socialism and corruption, and you will vote to reelect Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin whos done a great job. Matts a veteran. Hes a patriot. Hes done it all. Hes been a very, very successful business leader. He put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job hes done is incredible. Under his leadership, Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also. We work together. Now, he is difficult. I have to say, you know, maybe because of the election, but its okay. Look, hes such a pain, when he needs something for Kentucky like money, like aid, like, he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into Kentucky. Could you call the head of Some company in Japan, please I say, Matt, do I have to do it Please, please. But isnt that really what you wanted in a governor Thats what you want. Hes such a pain in the ass, but thats what you want. And the job hes done, one of the best in the country. Not the best. Hes been incredible. Matt is strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration. Thank you. Hes pro-worker, pro-life and 100% Pro-Second Amendment. By the way, youre going to lose your Second Amendment if you vote in Democrats. You think Im kidding I see what theyre saying. I watch what theyre doing. Theyre calling me all the time. You will lose your Second Amendment as soon  Im telling you. As sure as youre standing here, is anybody sitting Nobody ever sits. You can sit if you want. No, just stand. You know what they say in the fake news Look, youve been standing. Nobody sat I dont know. Isnt that exciting Nobody sat. You know what they say No, you know what they say They say, Trump only got one standing ovation. Because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down, but they dont say the second part. Its great. Great spirit. You know why You love our country. And you see whats happening. We have turned this big monster ship. We have turned it around. And we need so badly. You know, its like you plant a tree. It takes a lot. We have to get those roots to hold. We have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country, so many things. So many things. The best employment numbers, we have the best of everything. And I think Im going to count but I think its like 118. I told you, we have a record stock market today. I think about 100  Im going to have to check it. Because you know with the fake news, if Im off by half a point. If its 117 and not 118, even if I go under, they report it. They say, he didnt tell the truth. It was really 119. But like a lot, over 100, where we had the highest stock market in our history. Think of that. Thats incredible. But Matt Bevin has made record investments in education spending for Kentucky students. Education is so important to him. Matt Bevin will defend your Kentucky values. He loves his state. From an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left. Not good. I cant even imagine, how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left This guy, Beshear, is a major lefty. You know that, right Why are we even  Lets just have a good time. Are you sure we need an election tomorrow, Matt I dont know. How does Kentucky vote for a person  Im telling you, he will always vote for Pelosi and Schumer and shifty Schiff. How about this guy How about Schiff. He makes up a conversation. He gets up before the United States Congress. He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new president, a good guy, repeats it. I said, I never said that. He made a horrible statement. It was a total lie. And then I actually wanted to release the actual conversation. And you havent heard about the whistleblower after that, have you Because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks, youre going to find out. But these are very dishonest people, shifty Schiff. But Matts running against these people, and we have to send them a sign because theyre dangerous. The radical left named Andy Beshear, who rejects everything Kentucky stands for. Thats who they want to win. Beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of Donald Trump. What are the policies Take care of our vets, take care of our military. We want jobs. We want companies to stop leaving us. Theyre not leaving anymore. You see, companies arent leaving anymore. Have you noticed Remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this I mean, when I said lets do this, I said to our great now first lady. I said, Melania, lets give it a shot. And then, one by one, we were doing good. And what weve done, if you remember before we ran, companies were leaving Kentucky, they were leaving, they will go into Mexico. They were going to China, Japan. They were going all over. Any place but Kentucky. You dont read about that at all. Now theyre all coming back. Theyre all coming back. But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky. The greatest economy youve ever had, hes going to destroy it. And it wont be long. Itll go very quickly. You know, youre all sitting there. Everybody has good jobs. You dont like it, you go find another job. Its like the choice I got from military. I got you choice too. If you dont like your job, you find another one. You tell the boss, I am getting out of here, I dont like this guy. You go get a better job for more money. Beshear doesnt represent you. He represents the Washington swamp and hes backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election. Beshear supported crooked Hillary Clinton, and hes funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics. Open borders, let everyone pour right in. Let them all pour right in. Beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to Kentucky, think of that one. Releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent Kentucky families. He wants sanctuary cities. He hasnt learned whats happened. We had a great election a couple of weeks ago in North Carolina. We won two house seats. We were supposed to lose, probably both of them. We won them by a lot. We won them by a lot. And I think we won them because of the Second Amendment, because its under assault from Democrats. But I think we won also because of sanctuary cities. Because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities, really bad. And I think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot. Beshear is too liberal, too extreme and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky. Tomorrow, everybody needs to vote, Republican. We got to go Republican all the way. I want to bring up a man, and Im serious about this. This guy works so hard. Hes a great natural talent in business, which you needed. And he straightened it out. And Ill tell you what, he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state. Matt Bevin, come on up Matt. So were also joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington, your great Senator Mitch McConnell. Nobody works harder for Kentucky than Mitch. I will tell you, nobody works harder, and frankly, maybe more importantly, nobody works smarter. Its up here. I know a lot of people that work hard. He works smart. When the Democrat arsonists in Washington tried to destroy an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob. And thats what it was, it was a mob. There has never been a man treated so badly in Washington as Judge Kavanaugh, previously Judge, now Justice. We got him in, and hes been great, and he will be great. Mitch confirmed two tremendous Supreme court justices. Mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass VA choice and VA accountability for our amazing veterans. Now, I know Mitchs opponent because they came here. Do you remember last year Slightly different location, and thats okay, it was still the great state of Kentucky. Because Andy Barr had Amy McGrath, an extreme liberal against him. Andy Barr is here with us tonight, and were going to introduce him, but he beat her. So she said to herself, Well, you know, I failed in Congress, now lets go for the Senate. She wanted to go to the House, now she wants to go. Its not going to work that way. Extreme liberal, anti-gun, lots of different things. Amy McGrath compared my election, think of this one  Its so insulting. I shouldnt say it. Should I say it Yeah, why not. No, its so insulting. You know, you work so hard, you love your country so much, and they get up to say things. She compared it to 9/11, a slander upon our nation. She wants open borders. She supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody. She wants to get rid of it. She wasnt too happy with me last year. We came in, Andy, and we did a job on her, and this is going to be easy. She was caught telling donors, Democrats, that she is further left than anyone in the history of the State of Kentucky. Is that what you want Its not what you want. So next November, the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed Kentucky conservative, Mitch McConnell. But were going to get back to that later. Well be back many times. Well be back here many times. Mitch. Where is he So President Obama left Mitch, and me, and Rand, and all of us, he left 142 openings for judges. Youre not supposed to allow any. You dont do that. You know, they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges, right Including the Supreme Court, obviously. I came in and I said, How many do we have They said, How many what, sir I said, Judge openings. And I thought theyd say none, or one or two. He said, Sir, we have 142. I said, What I said, Tell me again. He said, We have 142. So Mitch and I and Rand would like to thank very much President Obama, because nobody ever been so generous in their life. Also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy, smart, strong, loves your state, and hes really become a good friend of mine. And Ill tell you, hes a little bit different. Its okay. But whenever Ive needed him, whenever I needed him, he was always there. Its true. I mean, sometimes like Id say,  I dont need you to vote, Rand. Good. And hell vote his own way. Hes got that little libertarian touch. Thats okay. Thats okay. But whenever we need, and Im not talking about me, Im talking about we, we need a vote, hes so incredible and hes become a really good friend. I want to have him come up for a second. Rand Paul, your Senator, a great warrior. Wow, that was excellent. Whoa. Wow, thank you. Thank you very much, Rand. Great job. Hes a warrior. Hes a warrior, Ive always said it. Also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are fantastic, a couple from outside your state, but well welcome them also, right But these are also great fighters, great warriors. Hal Rogers. Thank you, Hal. Brett Guthrie. Thank you, Brett. Thomas Massey. Man we just spoke about won a great grace, Andy Barr. James Comer. James, great. And from an incredible state that we won 2016 that Crooked Hillary said shes going to win that state, didnt come too close at winning that state. Its a great state, and we love the people of North Carolina. Congressman Mark Meadows. Along with some of your local great politicians, and a person thats done a really spectacular job. You know, in Michigan, a woman, she just kept going, she just kept going. Reminded me, by the way, of your governor, from the standpoint she never quit. Now, Republicans hadnt won Michigan in many, many years. She called, Could you come again Could you do it again Could you come make another speech, please I said, All right, this is the last one. No, no, no. How about a couple of more And then Bill Clinton actually told Hillary Clinton, You better get going, somethings going on in Michigan. Youre going to lose Michigan. You better start going. No, no, no. The polls say everythings good. And we won the great State of Michigan for the first time in many years. And I said, when it came time to picking the Republican Party Chair, head of the RNC, I said, I got to get the woman from Michigan, Ronna McDaniel, to head it up. And when they were saying how sophisticated Hillary Clintons campaign was  You know, were not sophisticated, right I dont think so. Remember all during the  Well, shes got the finest computer technology in the world. Yeah, she paid for it, but she didnt get it. She has really fantastic geniuses. But I had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had. His name was Brad Parscale, and hes here with us. Campaign Manager. Doing a great job. And our numbers are looking very good. But think of it, were one day short of a year now. Can you believe it Less than a year. It begins November 3rd this time. We had that great, great date, oh boy, November 8th remember Was there ever a day like that in television history And they have no idea, because when we do hang it up, theyre all out of business. They know that. Thats why I think that we will get  I expect to get a full, hearty, unbelievable endorsement very soon from the failing New York Times, and from the Amazon Washington Post. You know, before the election started, about a month before I announced that I was going to do this, I said, Im going to become a politician. I cant believe it. Im going to become a politician. But I looked at the New York Times, and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store, right The wind would blow it away. It was dead. I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail. But we built it up. They do stories  In my entire life, I had a few stories on the front page of the New York Times, and now if I have three or four a day, its like, Why are they not covering me anymore And theyre all bad. They can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world, and they make it look as bad as possible. In fact, I love dogs, but they gave the dog full credit. They didnt give me any credit. Thats okay. The dog got the credit, and the dog will be coming very shortly, by the way, to the White House. But theyll be endorsing us. And you know, all of these crazy, like CNN with its bad ratings, there goes its red light, it just went off. Their red light just went off. See how it is Well, its hard. Look, put yourself in their position. They have it on, their covering, and now they know theyre ready to get hit, so they turn it off. I mean, I cant blame them. Their red light just went off. No, but put yourself in CNNs position. Without us  You know, cable was not supposed to be a good business, then we came along. Its not me, its we. They came from the valleys, they came from everywhere, the cities, they came from places, theyre still trying to figure out, Where the hell did all those people come from Its true. A great Senator from Tennessee, they have early voting, and I was in Pennsylvania making a speech, and he saw me because he had a couple of great Congressman friends from Pennsylvania, and he said, You know, in Tennessee we have very early voting, and I just left, and Ive been doing this for 24 years. And I got to be honest with you, Ive never seen so many people vote. And these are people, they love our country, theyre incredible, they work hard, but they never liked what they were voting for, so they really wouldnt vote. Sounds terrible. But they didnt like anything that they saw. They say, Sir, Im seeing people, and he said this, come out from the valleys, come out from the mountains, come out from areas that theyve never come out. We have lines that are five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor. He said, I cant speak for the rest of the country, but if the rest of the countries like Tennessee, youre going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation. And thats what happened. That was a great statement. That was a great statement from people from a great state, also. Tomorrow you must elect the entire Republican ticket, from governor on down, including your next Lieutenant Governor, Ralph Alvarado. Ralph Alvarado. Great, Ralph. Youre a good man. And your next Attorney General, Daniel Cameron. Should I bring Daniel up Get up here, Daniel, come on. Heres a star. Heres a star. Mr. President, I hope you can tell that Kentucky is Trump country. We are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues, and here in the Commonwealth, we are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves. And Mr. President, we are going to stand with you in protecting the Second Amendment rights of all Kentuckians. And Mr. President, I make a personal commitment to you as the next Attorney General, we are going to make sure that Kentucky is never a sanctuary state. Good. Thats good. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Daniel. Star. A star is born. A star is born. Did you ever see that movie, A Star is Born Thank you, Daniel. Great. Youre next Secretary of State, Michael Adams. Thanks, Michael. Auditor, Mark Harmon. Thank you, Mark. Treasurer, Allison Ball. Shes doing great. And Agriculture Commissioner, Ryan Quarles. With the help of everyone here, America is the hottest economy anywhere in the world, by far. Foreign leaders come in to see me, Congratulations on your economy. Chinas doing poorly, as you know, but theyre paying us billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and theyve never given us 25 cents before. Billions of dollars. They gave a lot of that money to our farmers, who got targeted, but no longer. Theyre back buying from our farmers. But weve created 6.7 million new jobs since the election. And if I would have ever said that during the campaign, the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it. Think of that, 6.7. And today, just today, a record, 158 million Americans are now employed, the highest level of employment in our countrys history. African American unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have also reached the all time historic lows. The history of our country. Hourly earnings, listen to this, are up 9% since the election. Nobody ever thought that was going to be happening. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories. I thought that was a typo. I said, How the hell can you lose 60,000 It turned out to be right. And you know how I know Because Ive been saying it for two years, and they never corrected me. Its true, two years. I get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign, Sir Sir, we have an emergency. Whats the emergency Somebodys calling from the media, the fake news. Did you put a comma in the wrong location, sir Because they consider it to be a front page story. Okay. Under my administration, weve added nearly 10,000 new factories and many, many more thousands of factories are coming into our country. We reversed it. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts, massive. To lift up distressed communities, our tax law created opportunity zones. Tim Scott of South Carolina was so involved, including 144 designated by your great governor. By the way, the other governor. I dont think  Well, I dont know. You know Hes not going to do so well. Hell be calling for a meeting, and I wont be able to see him because I dont like him very much. But I like this one very much, and were going to help him. We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations. We ended the war on American energy. Were now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world. And we ended the war on beautiful clean coal. I announced the withdrawal of the United States from the horrible, costly, one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Ask them how theyre doing in Paris with it. Not too good. I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, and repealed Obamas federal coal moratorium. Were putting our great miners back to work. On trade, were starting to set records every week, were reversing decades of Washington disloyalty, stupidity, and corruption. Past administrations did nothing as China looted our factories, and stole up to 500 billion of American dollars. By the way, people cant even believe it. Not 500 million. Thats a lot. If you lost 500 million, thats a lot. I thought that was another typo. 500 billion they would take a year from us. We rebuilt China. And I give them a lot of credit, by the way, I give China. What I dont give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama, I dont give them credit because they let it happen. They should have never let it happen. But now were taking in tens of billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. Just recently, very slow, Slippy Joe  Biden that is, said of Chinas piracy and plunder, Theyre not that bad, folks. He always used the word folks. I watched him today, he used the word folks. Hi folks. Hi. Hi, My time is up. I got to leave. No, they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks. So I can just see these handlers, because theyre handlers, like they use on horses, theyre handlers, right All right, get him off now. Hes been up there long enough. So theyre screaming, Get off, get off Sleepy Joe, get off the stage, please. Please Joe, youre doing fine. Joe, youre doing fine. Youre doing fine. And then he goes, I love being in Ohio, but he was in Iowa yesterday. Yes sir. And they say, Dammit, he should have left sooner, we told him. Get off the stage, Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe, get off the damn stage. But he said about, Sleepy Joe, about China, Theyre not that bad, folks. Theyre not really competition for us. No, theyre not. 500 billion a year, right He did nothing in eight years, him and Obama. In fact, Im here because of them, when you think about it. Right Just thinking. Im here because of them. Kellyanne Conway, stand up, Kellyanne. Stand up. Another warrior. I just saw Kellyanne. I said stand up. No, but think of it, as somebody saying that. Now look, 1.5 billion that Hunter, who got thrown out of the Navy, who had no experience, who had not anything, got a lot of money from Ukraine, but he got 1.5 billion from China, I got to tell you, Ive been negotiating with China, theyre very tough. China. I got to tell you, Ive been negotiating with China. Theyre very tough. That is not the same group of Chinese people that Ive been negotiating with. They gave him 1.5 billion. Hell make millions and millions with that. And how about saying, by the way, Mr. President, would you please take over the negotiations that President Trump is no longer handling Guess what You would be sold down the tubes so fast, and were so close. China wants to make a deal so badly. I think theyd love to see another president. They would like to see another president more than crooked Hillary would, okay. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal, which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made. Has to be, because we started down here and they were up there. Has to be. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations This is what China would love more than anything else. Its not going to happen folks, because we cant let our country go back to hell. We cant do it. We cant let it happen. Because the Bidens got rich while America was robbed, and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in. I watched the last debate, and this weakling named Anderson Cooper saying, well, its totally unsubstantiated, Mr. Biden, solely answer. Whats unsubstantiated He is on tape doing a real quid pro quo. Sure, its totally unsubstantiated, sir. Ive never seen anything like it. Could you imagine if I did what he did Could you imagine if Don Jr. or Eric Trump walked out of China while I was, lets say, vice president or president. Lets say they walked out of China with 1.5 billion. Do you think the press would be saying, well, its unsubstantiated No, its something. Let me just tell you something. These people, not all of them, but these people are very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America is not for sale. And were more determined than ever to drain the swamp, and thats what were doing with these crazy people. A lot of bad things happened, and a lot of bad things I think are going to be revealed because theres no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with. Lets face it. These are bad people. Thanks to my tariffs, we will soon have over 100 billion from a country that didnt want to do anything with us. And Ill tell you, they started buying our farm product. You see that. They started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done. Last year, I got our farmers 16 billion because they were targeted. And the year before I got them 12 billion. I just took them out of the tariffs, and we had a lot leftover. And I said, congratulations farmers. I love you. I love our farmers. They love me. Thats why they did, they targeted our farmers. I said, congratulations. Thats compliments of China. And they do. They want to make a deal so badly. Frankly, honestly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal. Thats the way it is. Because were doing very well right now with China. Were replacing the NAFTA disaster with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. A huge win for Kentucky farmers, for Kentucky auto workers, for Kentucky manufacturers. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi so far and the do nothing Democrats dont want to give the people of our country a victory. Its really, let it be a bipartisan deal. I dont care. Its such an incredible deal for this country, and NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. Democrats need to pass the US MCA. We need their votes. Otherwise you cant pass it. And its up to Pelosi who has to put it forward, but shes too busy wasting their time. So either pass it or go back to San Francisco and clean up your mess. The Obama Bidens administrations trans-Pacific partnership would have dealt the death blow to the American auto industry. That would have been one of the great catastrophes. My first week in office, I canceled that job-killing travesty. You know all about it. Under our policies just days ago, Ford and the UAW announced a 1 billion investment in Louisville. 1 billion. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects. They were globalists. I was elected to be president of the United States, not president of the globe. They decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. Tell me, how is that good. They try and convince you its good. I was a very good student. Im a very like, were all smart. We sit back, we listen, and I say, these people are, something wrong with them. Only in Kentucky can somebody be so precise. Youre right about, you are right about that. They deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. The money we spend on other countrys militaries, but its coming down. And Im telling other countries, Im sorry, youre going to have to pay now. Im sorry. Pay. Pay. Pay, you got to pay. And they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair. We go in for internet. We want rural, well bring it in. And were bringing 5g into places like Kentucky that havent been properly served. Were bringing it in all over the middle West, all over the country. And were really ahead of schedule. Were doing really well. People will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out, but were doing very well. But you were very much underserved for years. And yet were investing billions and billions of dollars in places youve never even heard of. Doesnt make sense, does it But after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. We are finally putting America first. Yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past. They believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world. No thank you. No thank you. Thats why we ended the Paris Accord. Thats why Weve ended a lot. I dont even want to tell you. But the sellout of the American nation ended the day I took the oath of office and you understand that. Past leaders transform far away nations into chaotic war zones. Then they demanded that America accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions. Take the people, take the people. We defeated ISIS. We. When I took over three years ago, when we took over, when I took over, ISIS was all over. I defeated ISIS. I didnt even know to what extent. I was watching the other night the great Lou Dobbs, and he said, When Trump took over, President Trump, he used to say, Trump is a great president. Then he said, Trump is the greatest president since Ronald Reagan. Then he said, No, no, Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan. And now hes got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Thank you. We love you too. But we didnt fight them over there only to invite them over here. We didnt do that. Were not doing that. You see what were going and you see what were doing and you see its never easy because I get hit by the swamp 15 different ways, but it doesnt matter. Were doing the right thing to protect our communities. My administration implemented the travel ban on some of the worlds most dangerous countries. A lot of people were against it. They said, Isnt that terrible Countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldnt even believe its possible, and we have a travel ban now. We dont take people from those countries. Im sorry. And we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court, ruled it totally constitutional. On no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration. Democrats want open borders. They want to give illegal aliens free healthcare, free education, more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets. In the Republican party, we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our Southern border, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May. The wall is being built. Its going up rapidly. Its got a big impact. And I want to thank Mexico. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border policing our border because the Democrats will not do anything to end loopholes. It would take us 15 minutes and we could end the loopholes. Think of the word loopholes. They dont want to end the loophole. If you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities, you have only one choice tomorrow, and thats to vote for Matt Bevin. Democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day. The Democrats planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate Medicare. What are they doing I will always protect Medicare for our nations seniors. Its going to be protected. What theyre doing is crazy. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will also protect you with preexisting physicians. How about that Preexisting physicians. First time Ive ever said that, just thought of that. True. Because under their plan, you dont get your own doctor. You know what you get Whatever the hell you get. Thats what you get. Oh great doc, fix me up doc. You mean you want to work on my heart Who are you, doc I dont think so. Thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governors help, we have seen a 17% drop in overdose deaths in Kentucky, which is a record. Democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith. Anybody in here a person of faith Great people. The last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs. Last week my administration took action to stop that Obama era assault. It was an assault. And governor Matt Bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children, and there is no better leader than him, what he has done. And together were fighting for American orphans, foster families, and the sacred rights of religious believers. And hes done a fantastic job. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from their mothers womb right up until the moment of birth. And thats why Ive asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and its the party of the great Abraham Lincoln. We forgot that. Abraham Lincoln. The incredible rebuilding of our military includes over 100 billion investments all across the state of Kentucky. I withdrew our nation from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal. Its not the same country. When I came in that country, there were in 18 different sites of confliction, they called it. And now theyre a little different, a little different. Well see what happens with Iran. And I recognize Israels true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Remember Hed go around, oh, thank you so much. He wouldnt apologize to you, but he apologized to others. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Kentucky. The next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you. You have to do this. Look, maybe youll be late for work. Maybe youll be late for whatever. I dont want to know everything. Some things I dont want to know, but you have to just put it off. You have to go vote. Its so important. Tomorrow is so, because beyond even the governorship, and its so important. Because again, your state is setting records. In the history of your state, youve never done this well economically, job wise, unemployment, employment, factories moving in, new factories, open expansion of your car plants. Youve never done this well, but youre sending that big message to the rest of the country. Its so important. You got to get your friends, you got to vote. Because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. It just sends a bad, and they will build it up. Heres the story. If you win, theyre going to make it like ho hum. And if you lose, theyre going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. This was the greatest. You cant let that happen to me. And you know what You cant let that happen to your incredible state, Kentucky. You cant let that happen. That would be a disaster for yourself because youd be losing an incredible governor. But youre going to have a great victory tomorrow. With your support, you have to go out and vote. We will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not backing down and we will never ever back down. So tomorrow, we need you to go out and get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors. Get out and vote for governor Matt Bevin and all of these great Republicans. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress. 2020, were going to re-elect because of their stupidity. These people are on the run, and I will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand. And dont forget. Out of 194, we got 194, not one Republican left us last week. And two Republicans, think of that. And the other three couldnt get there because of, but they were votes. They said they were totally votes, had airport problems. I said, you cant do that. Airport problems. But then we had the Democrats. We picked up two Democrats, so we had bipartisan support. Thats unusual. I always say because theyre lousy politicians, theyve got lousy policy, but they do stick together. Thats about it. We will elect a Republican Congress in 2020. And well have a great speaker of the house in Kevin. Were going to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. Well enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending, listen to this, the AIDS epidemic in America within less than 10 years. Weve already started. Who would have felt we could have done that Weve started. In the past administration toward the end, we had certain things that we could have done. They didnt do anything. They didnt do anything, but we did. We have it all funded and we started, think of that, AIDS within 10 years will be out of this country. Nobody would have thought that was possible. We will end it. Great, great. I came into my office, they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made. Its incredible what theyre doing. And dont forget right to try, by the way, where somebody whos terminally ill can now use our medicines, which they were never allowed to in the past. So instead of traveling to Asia and Europe and all over the world, or going home hopeless and dying, they can now use what we call right to try. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest drugs, greatest labs in the world. They can now go and try. And we are having unbelievable success. Unbelievable. Right to try. We will chart a new era of discovery in space, and someday soon we will land on, believe it or not, the surface of the moon only to go to Mars. You know I said weve done the moon. No, they say, sir, we land on the moon to go to Mars, and thats what were doing with the moon. And we are really, really advanced. Its moving along rapidly. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. The great state of Kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth. These tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a home. They didnt have a lot of money. They didnt have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They love their families, they love their country and they love their God. These proud Kentucky Patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage. Our allegiance is to our nation. Our loyalty is to our citizens. And our devotion is to our Creator. For the sake of our freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, the best is yet to come. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Kentucky. Thank you. Go out and vote."
Hershey,Dec10,2019," Well, thank you to Vice President Pence. Thank you, Mike. And hello Pennsylvania. Hello. Its great to be back in this state that gave us the Liberty Bell, Pennsylvania Steel, Hershey chocolate. I like Hershey chocolate. The Nittany Lions. The Nittany Lions, theyre doing pretty well too and the incredible American Patriots just like you, you are Patriots. Thank you very much. Thank you. Under Republican leadership, America is stronger than ever before and we are respected again. Last month you saw it, we smashed expectations with another 266,000 jobs and unemployment is now more than a 50-year low. We have never seen whats going on with different groups. Unemployment is at a position weve never had anything like this. You are so lucky I became your president. Im only kidding. I have to say Im kidding because the fake news back there will take that. Theyll take that statement and theyll blow it up and theyll say, He said they were lucky to have him as president. What a horrible thing to say. Because theyre fake. Anyway, here in Pennsylvania you had the single best year that youve ever had in the history of our country, not bad. The Pennsylvania unemployment rate has reached an all time record low. And I hate to tell you this, when I was campaigning three and a half years ago, Id come here, you werent doing so well, folks. You werent doing so well. Wages were way down, unemployment was way up. It wasnt a pretty picture. Just a few months ago, I visited the new Shell Petrochemical Plant in Beaver County at 6 billion with a B, 6 billion. It is the largest investment in Pennsylvania history. Were ending decades of failed trade policies that devastated communities all across the state. For generations, American manufacturing was the bedrock of your economy, the bedrock. Remember the last administration,  You need a magic wand. Itll never come back. We found the magic wand, didnt we Then came NAFTA, the NAFTA disaster, I call it, one of the worst trade deals in the history of any country and the loss of one in three Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs. Your politicians always pledged to fix it. Theyd talk about it for years and years and decades, but they never were able to do it. They came and they went to Washington and they did nothing. But unlike those politicians, I keep my promises. And I love Pennsylvania. I went to school in Pennsylvania, you know that right I know it well. And Im thrilled to report that we are on the verge of ending the NAFTA catastrophe once and for all. Congress will soon vote on my new trade deal, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement or USMCA. After years of waiting, many, many years, many, many decades, theyve been looking for this, and then we got it done and weve been waiting for a long time for Nancy Pelosi to announce USMCA and she did it on the same day that they announced that they are going to impeach the 45th president of the United States and your favorite president, I think. And the reason they announced it on the same day, one hour later, they announce impeachment, a few guys standing behind her. They announced the impeachment, and then an hour later, she announced that shes going to USMCA. You know why Its a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment because they are embarrassed by the impeachment, and our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment. And think of it this way also, the silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt, thats the reason they approved USMCA. So thats okay with me, because they approved it and theyre very happy to have it. But honestly, its an incredible deal for our country. Took too long, it waited in Congress for too long a time. Incredible deal, and replacing the worst, NAFTA. Weve also just reached a deal with Congress to invest a record 738 billion more into our great military. When I took over, I will tell you, I became president Think of it, almost three years ago. By the way, was that the most exciting night ever Im just watching these people, that was one of the greatest evenings in the history of television from a rating standpoint, from an excitement standpoint, what the hell would they do without me and you Theyd be gone. About a month before I ran, I picked up a New York Times, it was like a leaflet that you had out at a grocery store and now its thick. Theyve got all their reporters covering Trump, Trump, Trump. I cant imagine they wont endorse because without me winning, you know what happens They all go down the tombs they got, all of them, Washington Post, New York Times, those very dishonest networks. They are very dishonest, very, very dishones. No, theyre very dishonest people. And I have to say this, look, and I always have to say this, you have some really great journalists and you have some honest publications, but not too many of them, I have to be honest with you. Well, you know that. Does anybody think the media is honest Does anybody think theyre totally corrupted and dishonest All right. The legislation will also officially establish something thats so important to me because its where its at. And a lot of people used to smile and now outside of the wall, which were building The wall is going on. It gets one of the biggest applause of anything, its the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force. Were opening up the Space Force because you know what, thats where its at. And everythings built right here in the United States. Thats simple. And by the way, we build the greatest weapons, the greatest planes, the greatest ships, we build it in the United States, theres nobody that comes close. We have the greatest military equipment anywhere in the world, rockets and missiles, no place builds it like us. We have the best in the world and we sell it to allies and they all want to buy from the United States. Weve never had a thing like this. We are so hot. We are so hot. And just a few weeks ago, the United States Special Forces brought the worlds number one terrorist to justice. Thanks to the strength and courage of our warriors, and theyre great warriors, the bloodthirsty savage known as Al Baghdadi is now dead. And he was quickly replaced by his second-in-command and his second-in-command is now dead. And weve got our eye on and our sights on third also, we know exactly where and when, but its becoming a very unpopular job, not a lot of takers and thats what we want. Go back to living a good normal life because America is winning again. America is winning again like never before. And as I always say, and Ive already said it twice tonight, this country is so respected and we were not respected four years ago, we were laughed at. But while were delivering historic victories for the American people, the radical left Democrats and the failed Washington establishment are trying to erase your votes, nullify the election and overthrow our democracy. Not going to happen, dont worry about it. I wouldnt lose too much sleep over it. And I have to say this about the Republicans, the Republicans And you have a lot of great ones here tonight, your Congressman. You have a lot of great ones, these congressmen are great. The Republicans have never been so United as they are right now, ever. The House, the Senate, weve never been this United because its all a hoax and they understand it. They also understand poll numbers, but Im sure that had nothing to do with it. But the impeachment hoax is about overturning your great 2016 vote, or in the alternative, trying to win the 2020 election. Thats not going to happen. Yesterday, the Justice Departments Inspector General released a report detailing the outrageous, scandalous and unprecedented abuses of power. Get them out. Get her out. Get her out. Get her out. See, these guys want to be so politically correct, you get her out. You see that Ill tell you, law enforcement is so great. That particular guy wanted to be so politically correct. We dont want to be politically correct. I dont know who he was, he didnt do the greatest job, so they tried to frame innocent people in the ludicrous It all started with the Russia witch hunt. Then the inspector general shocking report proved that the Obama FBI obtained secret warrants to spy on my campaign based on a phony foreign dossier of debunk smears, paid for by crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. The FBI failed to disclose the nature of the political hit job to the Pfizer court. They hid it, they deceived it, and they lied. The dossier was written by a discredited foreign agent who quote, Desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being the United States president. Whats this Folks, they spied on our campaign, they spied. Never happened before in the history of our country and were really wise to it. Were wise to it. The inspector general found that the FBI spying application contained 17 errors and omissions, commonly known as lies and deceit. When the FBI And you have great people in the FBI, but not in leadership. You have not good people in leadership, you havent had. When the FBI uncovered evidence showing that we did absolutely nothing wrong, which was right at the beginning, they hid that exonerating, you know that They hid it. They hid it so nobody could see it, so they could keep this hoax going on for two years. They knew right at the beginning that it was all a frame up, a set up, but they hid it so that nobody could see it, so they could keep it going on, thinking they were going to hurt us politically. But now were stronger politically than we were ever before. And the FBI also sent multiple undercover human spies to surveil and record people associated with our campaign. Look how theyve hurt people. Theyve destroyed the lives of people that were great people, that are still great people. Their lives have been destroyed by scum, by scum. An FBI lawyer forged, took an email forged, forged an email used as evidence, an act which is now the subject of a criminal referral. What they did is so unbelievable. Oh, I look forward I dont know. I dont know, keep away. I look forward to Bull Durhams report, thats the one I look forward to. And this report was great by the IG, especially since he was appointed by President Barack Hussein Obama. Considering that fact, it was great because we learned a lot of things that nobody would have found out variously, although I suspect we would have. We also know from a previous inspector general investigation that many of these same high ranking officials were consumed with anti- Trump and anti-Trump people hatred and bias, texting about an insurance policy, lets have an insurance remember Remember Peter Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page. Remember Lisa, I love you so much. Lisa, please, Lisa please. Lisa, Ive never loved anyone like you. We wont allow this to happen to our country. Lisa, please tell me you love me. Lisa, I love you. Peter, I love you. I love you like Ive never loved anyone. And if for any reason she loses, even though shes a stone called corrupt person, if for any reason she loses, Peter, weve got to have an insurance policy, we have to do it because were going to go  And thats whats been happening for the last two and a half years. It was their phony insurance policy. So FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, so in love that she didnt know what the hell was happening texted the head of Counter Intelligence, Peter Strzok, likewise so in love he couldnt see straight. This poor guy, did I hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing to keep him away from Lisa Thats what I heard. I dont know if its true. The fake news will never report it, but it could be true. No, thats what I heard. I dont know. I mean who could believe a thing like that No, I heard that Peter Strzok needed a restraining order to keep him away from his once lover. Ah, Lisa, I hope youre miss him. Lisa, hell never be the same. But he said hes not ever going to become president and Strzok look back, No, no, he wont. Well stop it. Well stop it. Can you believe we found these texts This is FBI agents at a high level. No, no. Well stop it. Theyre going to stop us from winning an election and then we have to listen, There was no bias. Oh, there was no bias. Think of these people, they write here was no bias. And yet he saying, No, no, darling, well stop it. And then they announce there was no bias. Now you know what were doing, and its not easy, and somebody said a regular president I dont want to use the word normal because thats not a nice normal refer A regular president would have been under a table, thumb in the mouth saying, Take me home mommy, this is too tough for me. Its true. True, they know. And while it was tough on my family, I have to say, very unfair to my family, very tough on my family. I have a great family, tough For me, its my life. I do it, I do it. Its one thing, but very tough on a family thing, a thing like this happens, its a disgrace. But day after day were exposing something called that filthy, disgusting, horrible swamp and were cleaning it up. And now after and a half years now that the Russia witch hunt is dead, a big fat disgusting fraud, the Congressional Democrats are pushing the impeachment witch hunt having to do with Ukraine, but thats already failing. You saw their so-called articles of impeachment today, people are saying theyre not even a crime. What happened All of these horrible things, remember Bribery and this and that. Where are they They send these two things and not even a crime. This is the lightest, weakest impeachment. Our country has had actually many impeachments, you recall judges and lots of many impeachments, but it was on today, everybody said, This is impeachment light. This is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country by far. Its not even like an impeachment. These people are stone cold crooked. When a guy like shifty Schiff, hes a corrupt politician, he made up my statement because See, I did one thing very good, as soon as I heard about this deal, I released my statement immediately, but he had already made horrible statements. And by the way, the whistleblower, the whistleblower defrauded our country because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue and we broke up the game. Remember the second whistleblower was coming, right And then the informer, who is the informer I know who the informer is. So the informer obviously gave him a false information because they wrote in the whistleblower report, they wrote something totally different from what I said, what I said was perfect. But it screwed up the whole works because most guys would never do that. They didnt even know probably that we had it transcribed, professionally transcribed, word for word transcribed, so beautiful. Am I lucky I had it transcribed Think of that. Think of that. So when I said release it And I dont like doing that because youre releasing it, its a conversation with a foreign leader, in this case, a very fine gentlemen, president of Ukraine, the new president of Ukraine. And we call them up and we said, Would it be okay Our secretary of state made the call, Would it be okay And they didnt know what we were talking about, but they said, Yeah, its okay. And by the way, he, his foreign minister, everybody did you know they said, There was no pressure. He didnt do anything wrong. There was no pressure put on us. That didnt stop anybody but we released the conversation and that gummed it up. Now, all of a sudden we never heard from the second whistleblower. We never heard about who the informer was. The whistleblower whos going to come out strong, hes disappeared. Wheres the whistleblower Hes disappeared. Hes gone. Maybe our great Congressman can find him. Hes gone. Maybe our great Congressmen can find him. Okay But the whistleblower is gone. He flew the coop because he reported incorrectly, and the IG, who didnt want to look at the conversation, he was so anxious to turn the whistleblower report over to Congress so that Congress could have fun with it, ought to be ashamed of himself. But today, the House Democrats announced these two flimsy, pathetic, ridiculous articles of impeachment. The House Democrats are walking back from everything they claimed. With todays announcement, theyre now admitting there was no collusion, there was no obstruction of justice, and there were no crimes whatsoever. There are no crimes. It says that, there are no crimes. Theyre impeaching me and there are no crimes. This has to be a first in history. Theyre impeaching me. You know why Because they want to win an election. And thats the only way they can do it. So the Democrats have nothing, and theyve turned the somber process of impeachment. And it was, you know, to me, impeachment is a very ugly word. Its a word I associate with some very bad times in our country. The good news is were having the best times in history in our country. Okay But the word impeachment, to me, is a very, very ugly word. Its a dark, ugly word. But, but I have to tell you, as bad as it is, it meant something. When you had serious high crimes and misdemeanors, when you had serious, go ahead, its impeachment. That would happen every 50 years, every 40 years, every 100 years. This was a big deal. Theyre making it so like, Lets do it every six months. Theyve cheapened a process. Theyve cheapened a process. These people are so bad, the radical left Democrats, and I actually think that Pelosi, who by the way, by the way, by the way, she has totally lost control. She has totally  Its being run now by this crazy AOC plus three. AOC plus three. Now its being run by other people. The far left has just grabbed that party. It is so sad to see. And she knew what would happen. I didnt, because I didnt figure the polls would go through the roof. They went out today. In Michigan, in Wisconsin, in a place called Pennsylvania. No, no. The polls are through the roof. Theyre called swing states, very important states. We won Pennsylvania the last time, and were going to win it again, but even bigger. Our polls have gone, over the last month, theyve gone through the roof. You look at it, take a look at it, it came out today. The FireHouse poll, its an important poll. It was always good. I never looked at it. Today, I like it a lot. Were up through  nobody can even believe it. So what Pelosi did, and as I said, they do the impeachment, then right away, lets do USMCA, right on top of it. Youd think shed wait like a day. She wanted to smother the impeachment crap, and thats probably what she did, at least to an extent. But any Democrat that votes for this sham will be voting to sacrifice their house majority, their dignity, and their career. Okay And some of these partisan lunatics have already said that if they fail this time, think of this. How about Low IQ Maxine Waters How about Green How about Green Weve Green. How about Green, where he said, We have to impeach him because if we dont impeach him were not going to win the election. This is what were dealing with. You know, were dealing with some very bad people. Were dealing with people that dont respect you. And by the way, you know they talk about the elite Youre the elite. Theyre not the elite. Youre the elite. Youre the elite. You got better education. You got better everything. Youre the elite. It always bothers me, they said, The elite. This is the elite. Look at these people. How beautiful. This is the elite. You know who are the elite You look at those jobs reports. Were the best in history unemployment for African Americans, best in history unemployment Hispanic Americans, best in history unemployment Asian Americans. Youre the elite. Youre the elite. But they said theyll do it again because this has been a total bust. Theyll do it again. And by the way, the Senates been so professional, so good, so strong, so solid. Just like these gentlemen in the House. So solid. So we have to vote these crazy people the hell out of office. And in 2020 Im going to work like hell that we take over the House. We have to take over the House. We have to. Right Got to take over the House, Mike. So here are the facts that Shifty Schiff  Is that guy the worst He comes up to a microphone, now he comes up to a microphone like two and a half years ago, I have absolute proof that the President of the United States conspired with Russia. Russia What the hell do I have to do with Russia By the way, Russia wishes that Hillary Clinton won. They wish. We are now number one in the world in energy. Russia is number three. Were beating out Russia and Saudi Arabia. Youd have windmills all over the place if you had Crooked Hillary. Theyd be knocking out those birds left and right. Those windmills. Wah, wah, wah. Darling, I want to watch television tonight and theres no damn wind. What do I do I want to watch the election results. Darling, theres no wind. The damn wind just isnt blowing like it used to because of global warming, I think. I think its global warming. Global warming. No more wind, no more life. The ocean is going to rise 1/8 of an inch within the next 250 years. Were going to be wiped out Look, I want clean air. I want clean water, crystal clean, I want, and thats what we have at a record level. Our air and our water are cleaner now than its ever been with all that were doing, and we havent closed up all of our industry, and we havent closed up our businesses and lost all those jobs. And right now, were by far the largest economy in the world. If you remember, you could look, if you go back five, six, seven years, in 2019 they say China was going to catch us as the worlds largest economy. Guess what Theyre way behind. Theyre way behind. Because over the last three years, you see the stock market set 131 records from the day. Think of that. And that means jobs, that means 401ks. I have so many people that come up to me, Thank you, sir. My wife is so in love with me because I went up 79% in the 401k. She thinks Im a genius. She always thought I was a total stiff, a dumb, stupid dope. Now she thinks Im a financial genius, sir. And all I did was buy some stock. I have stock in a 401k, and you made me into a genius, sir. She loves me so much more than she ever did. Shows you the power of money, right Isnt that terrible But I have so many people, 401ks are through the roof, your jobs are through the roof, we have the lowest unemployment rate. And now, more importantly than anything, wages are up for the first time in many, many years, decades, decades. You remember four years ago I was here, and I told people, I said, You know, 20 years ago, people made more money than they made four years ago. Not now. Not anymore. Because people now can not only make a lot more money, if they dont like their job, they go out and they get a different job, and they get more money, and ultimately they find one that they love. You have so many opportunities right now. Wages are up, jobs are up. And today we set a new record, almost 160 million people are working. Weve never come close to that number. Thats a hell of a number. But just quickly, here are the facts on Shifty Schiff. Dishonest guy, makes up my statements. He said, The President of Ukraine repeatedly declared that there was no pressure, but he didnt want to say that. We said, Say it. Say it, you crooked bastard, say it. But he doesnt want to say it. We said, Sat it Id like to force him to say it. Hell walk up to the mic, Ladies and gentlemen, guys a total corrupt guy. Listen, just to finish off, a man who I really, I dont know him, but I respect him because the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, and he said it so strongly, I have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance. He just said that the Democrats, who are corrupt, refuse to say that, and thats ultimately the only one that matters, the leaders of Ukraine, because theyre the ones that know of this pressure, not some crooked ambassador thats a deep stater, or thats a Bushy, or thats a Clintonite, or thats a Barack Obama ambassador. Okay The ones that matter are the leadership of the country that were talking about. They refuse to say it because theyre dishonest people. Theres only one way to stop the rabid partisan Democrats, Pennsylvania voters must show up in 2020 so we can take back the House, hold the Senate, and keep the White House. Its the only way. Only way. Okay, so Im going to ask these people to come up on this stage because we have warriors with us tonight. We love warriors, like the guys that killed al-Baghdadi. You know how much press I got I dont care about press. But Conan the dog got more than I did, and thats okay. Conan was almost electrocuted, he deserves it. They gave me about a day, and thats okay, because the people understand, we made a great decision. And remember this, al-Baghdadi was the founder of ISIS, al-Baghdadi was a vicious, ruthless person, al-Baghdadi created a caliphate bigger than the State of Ohio. Think of that, thats a big caliphate. And we now have taken 100% of the caliphate, and we have thousands and thousands of ISIS prisoners. With Obama, you did nothing. You did nothing but get your ass kicked. True. True. All right, were joined tonight by many of the terrific warriors that have helped me so much in so many ways. They fight for us. They really are incredible. And they come right from the State of Pennsylvania. Hey, do you ever notice where Biden keeps saying hes in the wrong state Like if hes in Ohio, Its great to be an Iowa tonight. If hes in Pennsylvania, Its wonderful to be in the State of Delaware. What is wrong with this guy Whats wrong with him Theres something wrong. Okay Theres something wrong. No, he keeps  How many times can you do that So far, it could happen, because you know I was doing six and seven a day that last month, that last beautiful month that I loved, I was doing six. I left these guys alone. I didnt want to do interviews, they were a waste of time. We just did these big beautiful rallies. And you know, if you start getting a little  you know, I went to Michigan, then I went to Wisconsin, then I went  Im sitting here saying, What the hell is going on These crowds are incredible. And we had the biggest crowds. By the way, to this day, there has never been, and theyll always correct me, in the history of politics, in the history of our country, there has never been anybody that drew crowds like we draw, and I dont have a guitar. I have no guitar. But this has never happened. I mean if you took Ronald Reagan, and we all like Ronald Reagan, I liked him, I thought he was a great guy, but if he came to Pennsylvania for a rally, if he had 1,000 people in a ballroom or something, you know I mean were getting crowds, 25-30,000 people, and then therell be 20,000 people outside. We set up screens outside, and if anybody would like to stand in the rain watching. And do you people out there, Im sorry, its pretty rough. But no, theres never been anything like it. One instruction get me the biggest arena you can get. We dont have empty seats. I mean look at this. How many seats is this 11,000 How much 10,500, its packed. Its beyond that. And dont forget, look at the floor, and then you go out. No, and then you go out and you look outside, and you have thousands and thousands because theres a spirit for what were doing. Were fixing our country, were healing our country. Were making America great again. So I want to ask a couple of our great warriors to come forward. Representative Glenn Thompson, come up here, Glenn. Come up here. A man thats been a friend of mine for a long time, Mike Kelly. Dont get in the fight with Mike. Come up, Mike. A wonderful man who represents this area, Scott Perry. Representative Lloyd Smucker. Lloyd. A guy who was always there for us, John Joyce. And two people that you all know very well in this state, they bring home the bacon, Dan Meuser and Fred Keller. Thank you fellas. Thank you. I want to also bring back our Pennsylvania Party Chairman. And I know his grandfather, I shouldnt say that to you. He was a tremendous man, Dan Tabas, but Im going to introduce somebody that Dan always said had tremendous talent. Little did I know that hed be working with us, and hes really working well. Hes smart, hes tough. Lawrence Tabas. Come on up, Lawrence. Come on up. Also with us tonight, Pennsylvania Trump Victory Chairwoman, Bernie. You know this, right You know this person. Comfort. Do you know who that is Do you know who that is Everybody knows who that is. National Committeeman Bob Asher, RNC Co-chairman Tommy Hicks has been incredible, and my friend David Urban. David. So I just want to thank, this is an amazing group of people, and with their help, and the help of everyone here, we are going to set records like weve never set before. You know, I used to say, and I sort of still have to say, 2016, I dont know if anything like that can ever happen, but I think were much better. All of the things I said, Were going to cut taxes. Were going to cut regulations. Were going to take care of our vets, look what we did for our vets, with choice, right Look what we did. Look what we did. We now have the ability to fire all of the bad people that are in the VA. Right Fired over 8,000 people that were disrespecting our vets. They wouldnt have done it in primetime, I can tell you that. But what weve done for our vets, what weve done in rebuilding our military, what weve done in so many ways, and we, unlike the Democrats, will protect your Second Amendment. Okay So weve done a job, and were proud of it, and we have tremendous people. Lets give them a hand, and thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, folks. Vote for these people. Even if you dont like them, vote for them. Oh, thats a beautiful new hat. Look at the hat that guys got on. Hows that hat working out Is that good I love that hat. Look at this guy, that says Keep America Great. Should we do the poll Should we do a poll Okay, ready So we have the greatest phrase in the history of politics, Make America Great Again. Wait. And we have our new phrase, because weve made America great. Ive told you, stock market, weve rebuilt our military, weve cut your taxes at a level that nobody could even think possible. Take a look at your median income, take a look at whats happened. The numbers, median household income, take a look at your numbers. With President Bush, it went up 400 in eight years. With President Obama, it went up 975 in eight years. With President Trump, it went up 5,000, but whoa, whoa, whoa, in less than three years. Thats a big thing. Wait. And then when you add energy savings, and you add tax savings, you have almost a 10,000 gain in three years. Thats a big difference. And thats one of the very big reasons why our, I think that and regulations, but thats one of the very big reasons why our economy is doing so well, because they talk about our consumer is loaded with money. Thank you very much, Mr. President, I appreciate it. But with the help of everyone here, we have now the hottest economy. You know when I meet dictators, and presidents, and kings, and queens, and prime ministers, they all come into that beautiful Oval Office. So beautiful, right So respected. And the first thing they almost always say, Sir, congratulations on your economy. Were trying to do the same thing. I said, You wont be able to do it. You wont. They wont be able to. Let them give it a shot. But they all say, Congratulations on the great job youve done with economy. But weve all done the great job. Not me. Weve all done it. Ive been your spokesman, and Ive done a good job as spokesman. But they all say that. But weve done a good job in many ways. You know, all of the promises that I made, Im the only politician in history that Ive actually kept more promises than I made. Think of that. In other words, I made here, like a thing like Right to Try, nobody talked about Right to Try. We got Right to Try. Thats somebody terminally ill, we have the greatest medicines in the world, the greatest doctors, the greatest labs in the world, nobody close, but it takes years to get it approved. And I got it approved so you can sign a document, get it. If you want to see the lives that were saving, its a beautiful thing. A beautiful thing is happening, Right to Try. Right to Try. But weve also created 7 million new jobs since the election. If I would have said that, the fake news would have gone crazy, they would have said thats impossible. These people would have gone crazy. They go crazy anyway, and I dont even say it. And right here in Pennsylvania, weve created 160, 000 brand new beautiful jobs, and you have companies moving in and moving back. And as I said, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment, the lowest ever in the history of our country, the lowest unemployment rates. Wages for low income workers have gone up more than 10%. Nobody thought that was possible. Theyre one of the biggest, in terms of a group, one of the biggest beneficiaries. This year, 40 million American families will benefit from the Republican Child Tax Credit, each receiving an average of 2,200. We ended the last administrations war on American energy, the United States is now, and I said it, and Ill say it all night long, number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, and theres nobody even close. In the State of Pennsylvania, natural gas production is up 34% since our election, 34. Virtually every leading Democrat has pledged to entirely eliminate American production of oil, clean coal, natural gas. I dont think somebody coming into Pennsylvania, you know those new petrochemical plants, they dont like them at all. Thousands and thousands of jobs. Incredible. Millions of dollars in taxes. How about going to the State of Texas We had one candidate who turned out not to be too good a candidate, right Beto, Beto. Remember So he wanted to get rid of religion, the Bible, he wanted to get rid of guns, and he wanted to get rid of oil. How about going to Texas and say, No Bible, no oil, think of this one, No Bible, no oil, no guns. I think you could be Abraham Lincoln and not win that particular race. And it wouldnt be much different in the State of Pennsylvania, that I can tell you. But you know, somebody that believes in that is Sleepy Joe Biden. He was caught telling a far left radical activist that he would shut down fossil fuel production in Pennsylvania. You saw that. But the voters of this Commonwealth will never, ever let that happen. Can you imagine a guy coming in, whether its him or anybody else They all want to do it. He just raises his hand, he has no clue what hes doing. They raise their hand. Remember he looked Do you want to give illegal aliens healthcare, even though were taking it away from our own soldiers that are up  and he looks and theyre all raising their hand Did you see that Well, he, Oh, oh, oh, okay, Ill do it too. In addition to replacing NAFTA, Ive taken the toughest ever action against Chinas trade abuses. They want to make a deal so badly. And were doing well with the deal, but they want to make a deal. Please make a deal. We dont want to pay tariffs anymore. Please, please. Thanks to our steel tariffs, steel mills in Pennsylvania are roaring back to life. And U.S. Steel has just announced 1 billion investment in Mon Valley Works in Pittsburgh. You know that, right 1 billion. They werent investing, they were divesting. The steel companies, its an amazing achievement. We tax all of the dumped steel, comes in from China and other places, 25%.  the dump steel comes in from China and other places. 25%. All of it. All of a sudden our steel mills are doing again. We need steel. Its not like you could say, Gee, well get it from another country. We need that for defense. We need it for our ships, we need it for our planes. We need it. We cant play games with steel. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. Very importantly, in everything we do, we are putting America first. Sorry. We gave up on the globalist folks. Lets build the world. Lets forget about our country. Lets just rebuild the world. Or no issue have the Democrat politicians more thoroughly betrayed the American people than on the issue of immigration. Far left politician I mean, theyre fighting me on the wall, you have no idea. But were building it and its fine and we have the money coming in from the military. Ive got it from here, from there, from there. Believe me, if I werent a good developer, you could forget about that wall. Ive got here, there, there. These people fought me and weve started winning in court. You know what Speaking of court, we will soon have 182 federal judges, including Court of Appeals. Nobody can believe it. All because Barack Obama gave us 142 empty seats. When youre a president, they always say, I disagree. I think the most important thing we can do is defense, right But beyond defense, they always say the most important thing you can do is judges and justices of the Supreme Court. We have two great ones. Great ones. But they always say, Judges and Supreme Court justices. When you leave office, I hope in 5 years, 9 years, 13 years, 17 years, 21 years, 25 years, 29 years. When I leave office Now Im only doing that to drive them totally crazy. That drives them crazy. Even joking about it. We have this idiot comedian who stands up, hes talking to a guest, right He said, You know hes going to win, dont you You know it. The guy goes, No, no. Were going to fight. Were going to fight. And they will. No, no, no. You know hes going to win. Then he goes, You know hes going to win. And you know hes never leaving, dont you Hes never leaving. At first I thought he was kidding. Hes a whack job. He is totally serious. He honestly believes that. I dont know, should we give it a shot Maybe well give it a shot. Im only kidding. Im only kidding. Media, Im only kidding. They wont write that, but thats okay. They wont write the, Im only kidding part. But far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities demonstrating their sneering contempt, scorned and disdained for everyday Americans. These jurisdictions deliberately release dangerous, violent, criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets, where they are free to offend, where they are free to kill, where they are free to rape, where they are free to beat up people except for ICE because ICE is much tougher than them. They dont beat up ICE. They dont beat up ICE. Youre lucky we have ICE. They want to put ICE out of business. Thats not happening. ICE is Theyre incredible people. Theyre great patriots and theyre tough. Thanks to Democrat immigration policies, innocent Americans in all 50 states are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals. Last summer, at least 19 illegal aliens were charged in connection with grizzly homicides, including hacking victims to death and ripping out, in two cases, their hearts. Weeks ago, two illegal aliens and members of the savage gang, MS-13, who we are removing from our country by the thousands, were charged with relentlessly beating a wonderful, beautiful high school teenager to death with a baseball bat and chopping the body apart with a machete. One of the animals accused was previously released by local authorities in defiance of an ICE demand. ICE warned and said, You cant let them go. They wanted them. They would do anything for them. They wanted them to hand this animal over for deportation back to his country. Get them the hell out of our country, right Democrats sanctuary cities also give safe haven to those who commit violent sex crimes. Since Montgomery County, Maryland declared itself a sanctuary jurisdiction in July, we have already identified nine illegal aliens who have been arrested for rape, sexual assault, including a 26-year-old man charged with raping and viciously strangling a young, wonderful woman who was entering her apartment, innocently entering her apartment. She was raped and killed, strangled to death. Sanctuary city. Maryland. But these are only the cases we know about. Sanctuary cities and jails actively conceal illegal alien crime and criminals from federal government. Federal government wants to take them out, or in some cases, if its real violence, and we dont want to pay for the cost, but we do, put them into very strong jails. The sanctuary city of Philadelphia. The sanctuary city in Philadelphia is one of the very worst sanctuaries anywhere in America. Did you know that I mean, I know Philadelphia well. Going to school here, we never heard about sanctuary cities, did we Weeks ago an illegal alien charged with rape, sexual assault of a child, and inflicting serious bodily injury was released by Philadelphia to wander free in your communities. By the way, you may have the worst district attorney or whatever the hell you call it. This guy, Ive been hearing about this guy, he lets killers out almost immediately. What the hell How did you let that happen Instead of handing them over while still in jail, they defied ICE. They fought with ICE and set him loose upon an unsuspecting family. Thankfully, at great time and effort, our brave ICE officers were eventually able to track him down, arrest him, detain him, and do what has to be done. How do you elect Democrats when they create a sanctuary city of Philadelphia I dont get it. Four MS-13 gang members were also arrested in Pennsylvania in connection with the brutal and sadistic murders of a 21-year-old and a 15-year-old. As we speak, a criminal illegal alien with three prior deportations is roaming free in Pennsylvania because he was released by the city of Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. You better get yourself a new prosecutor in this place, I want to tell you. Thats a horrible thing. No, its a national story, how he wants everybody to not pay the price. Youre talking about not paying the price for rape, for murder, for other horrible crimes. How stupid can you be The charges against this alien include rape, aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, indecent exposure, and terroristic threats. Other than that, he was a very nice person. Philadelphia has defied ICE and released illegals charged with everything from assault, to kidnapping, to drug crimes, to sex crimes, to homicide murder. Democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos. Republicans stand for law and order, and we stand for justice. We stand for justice. We side with law enforcement and with law-abiding Americans, not ruthless gang members and not violent criminals, aliens that come into our country illegally. They take our payments. Payments. Some of these people with these crazy laws that you have. Look at whats going on in California. They do better than our great veterans. They do better than citizens of our country. And they advertise, We will take you. We will take care of you. We will pay for it. And then you wonder why we have so many people trying to come through at the borders. But we do a great job. Were removing these criminal illegal aliens from our country by the thousands. Were sending them home, and were not letting them come back in. Were being very tough. Mexico is now giving us 27,000 soldiers at our border. And Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, we signed a very important agreement with each. When their people come into our country, they werent taking them back. Now they take them back and they say, Thank you very much. They werent taking them back. If we had a murderer from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, we want to bring them back under past administrations. They bring them and they say, We dont want them. Dont land. Youre playing with us. They say, Thank you very much. We will take them back. Because weve let them know the price is very bad if they dont do that. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, illegal crossings are down 75% since May and the wall is going up at a very rapid pace. The radical Democrats have gotten more and more extreme. Thats why they did this impeachment hoax, because Nancy Pelosi had absolutely no control. She knew what was going to happen. She knew. The radical left has taken over the Democrat party. Democrats are pushing for a socialist takeover of healthcare that would strip you of the doctor and coverage of your choice. We have 180 million people with private healthcare that love it. Theyre going to take it away from you. I dont think so. Crazy Elizabeth Warren, or as I affectionately call her, Pocahontas, her ridiculous plan would cost 52 trillion. Thats more money than we take in in one year, two years, three years, four years, five years, six years, about seven years. Thats for one year. 52 trillion. And you dont have your doctor. I mean, the whole Well, shes starting to crash again. I thought I knocked her down. I did that heavy, heavy Pocahontas deal. I give her credit. I thought she was left for I mean, there were just little embers, and then she rose. She rose, then she became strong. But then she opened that fresh mouth of hers and it stopped. It stopped. I dont see her as a threat. I dont think she makes it. I mean, you dont know. Crazy things are happening in the Democrat party. It used to be a sane party. Now its an insane party. So you dont know. But theyre all looking at the same thing. I mean, you have Alfred E. Neuman whos running, whos this guy. This guy Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Can you believe hes doing well Hes like the leading fundraiser. I dream about him. Its true. No, Buttigieg. But Im not going too far with any of these people because I thought I was way too early with Elizabeth Warren. We destroyed her too fast. So she came back. But shes going back down again. Did anybody see her beer deal where she said, Darling. Did you ever see that deal Darling. Its about her husband. Darling, its great to see you. What are you doing here Its like, Thats her husband, hes supposed to be living in the house. Youre here. I dont think shes seen him in 10 years. Hey, I have an idea. Can I get a beer Lets get a beer. She wants to be one of the group. Hey, lets get a beer. Did you ever see such a phony, disgusting deal Republicans will defend your sacred right to choose the doctor, and you can choose your plan, and you choose the plan thats right for you. We will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions. We will also protect your right to get the physician that you want. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb, right up until the moment of birth. This character in Virginia. Did you see the Virginia governor I mean, he gave a whole expose. The baby is born, and then basically, they start talking to the mother. The baby is born. And theres no other word. If the mother decides no, then they execute the baby. Okay Hes the governor of Virginia and why the Republicans arent going to win Virginia this next election, 2020. Ill tell you what, were going to give it a very strong shot. When you have people like that, were going to give it a very strong shot. But thats why Ive asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion. Because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the party of honest Abe Lincoln. Party of Abe Lincoln. I told you about judges. Im telling you about so many other things. Theres nobody thats ever done what were doing. You look at school choice for every child in America who needs it, including the 50,000 Pennsylvania students who your Democrat governor has blocked from getting school choice scholarships. No scholarships available. Whats that all about How did that happen I withdrew from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal, a disaster. I recognize Israels true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Pennsylvania. Youve never had that better year. Never At stake in our present battle is the survival of the American nation itself. Its the survival. We will destroy our country if these people get in. I say weve done so much in the first three years, will soon be four years. All of a sudden the time will be up. But its like when you plant a tree, it needs time to grab on. It needs time to let it Its got to grab. Thats what we need. We need time. And we have other things were going to do that are incredible. We still have tremendous regulation cutting that we can do. Weve cut more regulations than any president in the history of our country. We did it in less than two and a half years. Two and a half years. We did it in less than two and a half years. Some had eight years, one had more than eight years. More regulation. And we have regulation, and you need some regulation, but you dont need regulation that doesnt allow you to build a simple road or highway. So what weve done has been incredible. Thats one of the reasons our job numbers are so good. If you want your children to inherit the birthright of American Liberty that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020, and we have to get rid of the Democrats in the House of Representatives. They are stone cold crazy. Only this way can we save the America we love and clean up Washington corruption once and for all. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. We have tremendous prosperity going on in our country, and the people in this room are I mean, you know whats happening. You know whats happening with your families. You know whats happening with your jobs. Youve never had a time like this. They always say, Are you better off now than you were four years ago I mean, who is better off now Everybody, I think. Everybody. But together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. We just finished a deal with South Korea, a great new trade deal. We just finished a 40 billion deal with Japan. Were in the process of getting our deal done. Lets see what happens. They want to make it more than I do with because were taking in a lot of money. We havent taken in money from China ever, and its coming in now by the billions. When they target our farmer, I give our farmers that money that theyve been targeted and our farmers are thrilled. We have a lot leftover, but we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. Well have that done within 10 years. It could have started. That could have started earlier than the beginning of our administration. Well have that done in less than 10 years. Think of that. The AIDS epidemic will have ended in America within less than 10 years. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, one great country. One America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, In God we trust. We stand on the shoulders of generations of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. Pennsylvanias the place where our founding fathers declared American independence, where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, and where General George Washington led his men across the Delaware on Christmas night. They used the password. You know what the password was Victory or death. Victory or death. How incredible is that Victory or death. Pennsylvania is the state that gave us self-made titans of American industry, from Andrew Carnegie to Milton Hershey. I love Hershey. I love Hershey. And Henry J. Heinz. Pennsylvania is the place where strong American workers mine the coal, work the railroads, and forge the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world, and we are making it even greater every single day. Its greater than ever before. And proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. They are trying to take your power away. It will never ever happen. With your help, and with your devotion, and your drive we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are going to keep on winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. Ladies and gentlemen of Pennsylvania, the best is yet to come. Because together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you."
Minden,Sep12,2020,"Well, I thank you very much. So I want to start by saying, Hello, Nevada. How are you doing How are you And Im thrilled to be in Douglas County, but people are coming from all over the place. Theres a lot of people for Douglas County, isnt it We have thousands and thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots, thats what we have. And 52 days from now, were going to win Nevada, and were going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that well negotiate, right Cause were probably, based on the way we were treated, were probably entitled to another four after that. And it should never happen to another President. Thats just a dishonest group of people. But here we are, and were going to be here for another four years. The governor of your state-  tried very hard to stop us from having this event tonight. He didnt like us having They can have riots and they can have all sorts of things and thats okay, you can burn up the house, thats okay. We call this a protest because if you call it a protest, youre allowed to have it. Its okay. So if anybody asks you outside, this is called a friendly protest, okay Its true. You cant have political rallies. Thats because of me, because if Biden were here, hed have about three people. Do you ever see him with his little circles The circle You know why he puts the circles Because he wants to be like correct with COVID, but its not really because they cant get anybody to fill up a room. So they put these big circles. So he cant get anybody to fill. Nobody wants to go. Oh, boy, the fake news, look at all those people back there, the fakers. Thats true. Boy, they covered. Did you see the other day, now theyre finding out that to do an interview, an interview, they ask him a question. That means theyre giving him the questions, they never gave me questions before. So to do an interview, he demands on getting the questions, and his people write out the answer. So they ask him a question. He goes, Bring it up closer, I cant see it, dammit. Great. This is something. You know, we have a debate coming up in three weeks. And heres the problem. Winston Churchill. Did you ever hear of Winston Churchill Winston Churchill was a great debater. Great. And if Joe gets off the stage, walks off the stage, if he makes it, which I think he probably will, in all fairness, hes been doing this for 47 years, right I think he probably will. If he gets off the stage, theyre going to say it was the single greatest debate theyve ever seen. Winston Churchill was nothing compared to Sleepy Joe. You know that, you know that, theyre going to say, What a great performance. He was great today. He was great. This guy was great. Nah, hes not great. But your governor tried to stop us. He tried to stop us. The governor of Nevada, he tried to stop us, and we went to different venues. Kelly ODonnell, shes a fading reporter for NBC. Do you know that She was on, she said, Well, they have a crowd tonight. Behind her, it looked like 25,000 people. Thats what we have, by the way, a lot more coming in. But she said, Hes got maybe a thousand people, a thousand. You know what I got I have a thousand people here. No, this is the fake news. You know what Its not a question of how many They are just a bunch of dishonest people, Ive never seen anything like it. Being in real estate and being in New York and being in all over, Ive seen a lot of dishonest people. I think the media, the fake news is the most dishonest group of people Ive ever seen anywhere in my entire life. And that includes, by the way, leaders of foreign countries that arent our friends, okay Thats a big statement. They really are bad news. But here we are, and this is really amazing. The governor tried to stop us, he couldnt, but think of this, hes in control of millions of votes. Heres a guy calling venues, telling them not to have the rally, calling different venues, Dont have the rally. Were not going to let you have the rally. And hes calling, this governor who was a political hack, he was a political hack, and then he became governor. And this is the guy that were entrusting with millions of ballots, unsolicited ballots, millions and millions. And then were supposed to win these states, and we have a guy that would do that where he wont let us have, and we call it a protest and therefore we can do it. But you want to know something Its a disgrace. So who the hell is going to trust They say, Trust government. Well, how would you trust a guy that fought that we arent here, that we cant have all these thousands of people Boy, you are really back far. Thats Look at that. No, but seriously. And now hes in charge of the election and the millions of ballots. So if Im up like millions of votes, he can rig the election, he can rig the election. And Ill tell you what, whether its in North Carolina, whether its in Michigan, whether its in other states where theyre sending out, theyre going to be sending out 80 million ballots. And its Democrats. Theyre trying to rig this election, at every single place in the last year, year and a half, go modern day, forget about Tiny amounts, a congressional race in New York, a small number of votes. If you go to New Jersey, if you go to Virginia, if you go to Pennsylvania, if you go to California, look at some of these races, every one of these races was a fraud, missing ballots. And I dont mean like 1%. I mean like 20%, 25%, theyre trying to rig the election. They should make people, if you register, if you want a solicited ballot, thats where you ask for it. You have to sign papers. You get it because you cant be there. Thats one thing. When they send 80 million ballots to people, they have no idea where theyre going. Actually, they probably do have a good idea where theyre going, and thats our problem. They send 80 million ballots out. Where are they going Who are they sending them to Are they sending them to certain areas and not other areas Are they sending them to Democrat areas These are all controlled by Democrat governors, like your politically motivated governor. So, just to finish on that, look, just to finish on that, hes a guy that tried to silence us by not having this. And it ended up, our crowd turned out to be a lot bigger than NBC, which is owned by Concast. C-O-N, Concast. C-O-N-C-A-S-T, Concast. Its really Comcast, but I call it con because its a whole con. Ill tell you what, in the old days, I think it should still be, news when they broadcast had to be reasonably accurate, right And they had licensing. Today, they can do whatever the hell they want. Its fake news, and its a disgrace. And you know what, back there, and Ill tell you, its hurting our country. Its hurting our country. Theyre the biggest problem that this country has is the fake news media, worse than the Democrats, because the Democrats are their partners. They play together. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years selling out America, offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, depleting our military and sacrificing your childrens future in China. Ive spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to America, securing our borders, rebuilding our military and standing up to China like never before. Nobody has ever stood up to China like we have stood up to China, and you havent seen the last of it. Sleepy Joe Biden, who surrendered, you know where he is now, hes in his damn basement again. No, hes in his basement. Hes in his basement. But I can be bad to him because he put the most vicious ad on television that Ive ever seen. Do you know what Im talking about Where Im standing over the graves of our fallen warriors, our fallen heroes. These are great people, the greatest people there are, and Im standing over there and they have some sleazebag reporter from a third rate magazine having some source quoting me saying, I wont even use the term, but saying bad things. And theres nobody that loves our military, respects it and the people more than me. And they took And I didnt even ask. We had 25 people that were witnesses that are on the record already that have said that never took place. It never took place, what they said. And yet pathetic Joe, and hes a pathetic human being to allow that to happen. Heres the problem, he doesnt even know what happened, I dont think. I think he has no idea, but hes a pathetic human being to let that happen, where they put an ad like that, where Im standing over graves. And then they said, He said this, with no sources, no nothing. They got nothing. And I have 25 real witnesses with the names, with everything, saying it never happened. And they put an ad like that up, theyre a disgrace. But you know the good part Now I can be really vicious. I can be really vicious. And well start by saying, were going to start by saying that the Democrats are trying to rig this election because its the only way theyre going to win. The only way theyre going to win is to rig it. Bidens surrendered your jobs to China. Look, his son walked away with a billion and a half dollars, give me a break, give me a His sons going to say, Dad, you cant take this money away. Dont do it, Dad, please, I dont You know how much experience he had Theres a young man here, hes a very young, young man, handsome young guy. Hes about like 12. You know what Hes got more experience than Hunter. Hunter. Wheres Hunter Where is he With no experience, no knowledge of energy, no job, got thrown out of the military You know he got thrown out, by the way. I used to be nice about that. Now I dont. Once I saw that ad, I dont have to be nice anymore. Okay, I really mean it. And by the way, on that ad, I know some horrible people, horrible human beings, some of the worst people in the world, I really do, theyre horrible, none of those people, and theyre the worst, the worst, real estate developers in New York, you dont get much worse. I know some of the worst people in the world, not one person do I know that would say that, standing on top of graves, of heroes, really, not one person. So I will tell you this, so now we can play it like it is. Lets face it, Joe is shot. Lets face it, okay Hes shot. So not that he has anything to do because he wont know whats happening. Hell just be locked up in a room someplace, and the radical left is going to be running our country. Four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years Thank you. But now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob. You know that. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. You see whats going on with all these democratic or I always say Democrat-run cities and states. Its a disaster. Its a disaster. And we keep saying, Let us bring in the troops. Well, we did it in Minneapolis, we ended it. In 45 minutes, it was ended. They went through two weeks. By the way, we could do it in Portland in half an hour. It would all be over. But we have these stupid people that think How about that poor mayor Is that pathetic, Wheeler, is that pathetic They forced him out of his home. Hes now finding a new home, its so nice. Its pathetic. Honestly, its pathetic. We could solve that problem in a half an hour, just like we did. And by the way, the US Marshals did a great job in Portland. They did a great job. You know what I mean. If Biden wins, the rioters win, the anarchists win, arsonists, flag burners, they all win. Im running for reelection to bring prosperity to Nevada, to the whole country. Ive been here a long time. I have some things in Nevada that are very good to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China. I do get a kick out of watching a guy, Oh, Im going to do this. He copied my whole plan. You see, he says, Buy America, I said, Where the hell have you been for the last half century Thank you. Could I ask the fake news to take your cameras and show all the way back there for hundreds of yards, all the way back there. Take your cameras. Go as far as the eye can see. No, no, tell NBC News its not a thousand people. You cant see it. You cant see it down here. You wont believe how many people. That thing goes back So the bottom line is when we win, America wins, thats whats happening. And nobodys done to China what I did. Look, billions, tens of billions of dollars of tariffs we took in. I gave 28 billion to farmers. The farmers are doing very well. Theyre doing very well. Thank you. Thank you, President Trump. 28 billion. 16 billion one year 12 billion. They were targeted. I said, How much is it Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, said, How much were they hurt by Sir, 12 billion two years ago and 16 billion last year. I said, All right, good. Well take it out of China. We gave them 28 billion, to the farmers. That never happened before. You think Joe Biden would even think about it He wouldnt even think about it. He wouldnt even think about it. No, hes more worried about, does he have a teleprompter to answer a reporters question. The worst part about that isnt the fact that hes doing that, because lets face it, hes unable, okay Its not that, its that the fake news would give him the questions. They never gave me the questions. Did you ever give me questions, back there Did you ever give me They dont give me questions. The fake news would give him questions, but of course now Donna Brazile works for Fox, so thats gone a long way. Remember Remember when Donna Brazile gave crooked Hillary the questions, right To a debate And then she said, Well, I dont think I did it. I dont remember. I knew she was in trouble when she said, I dont remember doing that. I dont remember. She didnt remember. Oh, okay. Well, as long as you dont remember. Its true. Its true too. Its true. You know what, I used to stand back and Id say, Be quiet, please. Dont say that. Its really not nice. You know its true. She deleted 33 Think of it. Theyll never find the emails because they were acid washed, deleted. But you know what She got a subpoena from the United States Congress, right And she and her lawyer deleted 33,000 emails after she got a United States subpoena. And you say, Why isnt she guilty of a major crime Right And then she took her telephones and she smashed them with a hammer. Right And then she took the other ones, and she deleted them. And now the Mueller scam, these people, the worst people. I have a friend, a very smart guy, very streetwise guy. He said, You have to be the most honest guy in the world to go through three years of investigations, where they have the worst human beings in the world. They worked for the Democrats. They worked I mean, Mueller didnt have a clue. This guy was totally But look at this Weissmann, how bad was Weissmann He deleted his phone. Thats illegal. He deleted everything. They all deleted. And they all said, Oh gee, we made a mistake. Were sorry. They all used the same mistake. They all made It was, Oh gee, we didnt mean to do that. Every one of them, all of them. I think it was 31 different phones, they deleted. These are criminals were dealing with. And theyve got to There has to be a repercussion. There has to be a repercussion. Were dealing with criminals. So I dont care if you say it anymore because you know what She illegally deleted, and her lawyers should go to jail with her, okay And the fact is the Republican party doesnt play it rough and tough like those people, they dont play it the same way. Theyre too nice. And we have better policy. Thank goodness we have better We believe in borders. We believe in no sanctuary cities. We believe in lowering taxes. We have better, but our people dont We have some that are very good. Jim Jordan, good, right Jim Jordan. Mark Meadows, good, right No, we have some very good, but Ill tell you what, we play it so nice, and in the end its not right because what they get away with And Obama and Biden got caught spying on our campaign using the intelligence, I put that in quotes, using intelligence to spy on our campaign, and they got caught. They got caught. And if it was me that got caught, forget about it. But they got caught and somebody said,  Well I know, but he was President. Oh great, Im President too. And a hell of a lot better President than he is, I can tell you that. Obama came into office, they gave him the Nobel Prize, like almost immediately, right In fact, he didnt even know why he got it. He didnt even know, he had no idea why he got it. And he was right about that because nobody else does either. They still dont know, but weve done a lot of things. So we were nominated a few days ago for a Nobel Prize, which is a big thing. Nobel Peace Prize. And then yesterday we were nominated a second time for another Nobel Prize. Now, thats a big thing. To me, its a big thing, even though obviously its a very political thing, but its a very big thing. The Nobel Peace Prize, right I got, it was just reported. Im just reporting this, I got zero time on the nightly news, on the network news. Zero, zero. We got zero time. Think of it, the President of your country is honored by being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and your nightly news, ABC, which is terrible, CBS, which is terrible, and probably the worst of all owned by Concast, they spend a fortune on PR, and then every time I get up, I call them Concast and sort of wipe out their fortune. But they are bad people. But NBC is the worst of them all, not one mentioned. These people are corrupt. Not one mentioned, not one mentioned. So your President gets a Nobel and, at least a nomination, and they dont mention it. Joe Biden cannot lead our country because he doesnt really believe in our country. Right now, I dont think he believes in anything, he just wants to go to sleep. Thats all. Please, darling, I want to go to bed. Im exhausted. I made one speech yesterday. But darling, they gave you the answers and the questions. I know, but that was a big strain because my eyes, I couldnt see the teleprompter. This guy is the worst. I am And you know, its going to maybe come back to haunt me because we have a rigged election. Its a rigged election. Its the only way were going to lose, but Ill tell you what, he is the worst candidate in the history of Presidential He is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. He doesnt know hes alive. He doesnt know hes alive. And I got to know President Xi of China very well, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong-un. By the way, what happened to the war I thought we was going to war with Kim Jong-un. Wheres the war Wheres the war Oh, I see. Oh, I see. It never happened, did it Never happened, did it Well, maybe some day, could happen. No, remember Trump is going to be   You know my personality, right Trump is going to be a war at within the first week after he wins. Wheres the war.In fact, the peace prize was because I stayed out of wars, and by the way, ended certain Wars that could have happened that you dont even know about. And look what we did just yesterday in Europe, and look what we did with Israel, and you just saw that, with United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Now, after this is over, youll have like at NBC, this third-rate reporter stand up. They had a small crowd, a insignificant crowd, in a great location. You know how great it was We landed, we had to drive for 50 minutes. Thats how great. But I like it anyway. Ill take it. Ill take it anyway. I like it. Youre my kind of people. We love each other. I like it. We landed the big, beautiful Air Force One. I just asked as were coming in, Why couldnt we have landed here I would have rather, then I could have had the plane right behind me. Instead, we have the beast. See the beast. What you dont know is the beast costs almost as much as the plane. Its a hell of a car. Its a walking army tank, the beast. But we could have. I said, Why dont we just land here And we couldnt. So I get off the plane. Oh, good. How long will it be About 50 minutes. Thats a long drive. And driving here, there were tens of thousands of people on the streets with flags. And then you read these fake reporters and they say, President Trump is tied in Nevada, tied. I dont think so. The only way were tied is if they screw around with the ballots, which they will do in my opinion. Okay Were not tied anywhere. I asked some people that traveled with Obama. I said, Was it the same thing They say, Not even a tiny fraction of what you have. Theres not even a fraction. We have more enthusiasm. We have more spirit than any campaign that anybodys ever seen. Its true. And that includes 2016, where the enthusiasm obviously was great. How about all those states that we werent supposed to win No, he wont win there. He wont win there. Then all night long, Donald Trump won the great state of Texas. Donald Trump won the great state of   this and that, and one after another. Was that one of the coolest things, watching their people go crazy They went crazy. No, they went crazy. How is he going to do in Georgia Well, I think George is going to be very close. Its going to be very close. They go, The polls in Georgia have closed. Donald Trump wins the state of Georgia. You know why Because we won by so much, that they can do it simultaneously by saying, The polls closed, and he won. We had many of them. Right And by the way, were doing great. I just had  Florida is a biggie, a good one. And we are winning in Florida by a lot, so thats good. A lot. Ill tell you here, because you dont read about that stuff. They dont like to write that. They dont like to write it. They have all fake polls. Ill tell you what, the polls are worse than the writing. Actually, in my opinion, the polls, theyre suppression polls, theyre meant to make people discouraged, Even me, Im supposed to be discouraged. And fortunately, four years ago, we werent discouraged, because if we would have believed the polls, nobody would have voted. The concept is really make people feel so that on election, they go, Darling, lets go out to dinner. Its so sad about the president. I wish he was going to win, but lets go out to dinner. Then well come home. Lets not bother voting, right Lets not bother voting. See, its a suppression, but my people might dont get suppressed. My people go out and vote. My people go out and vote. Theres no suppression. Phony polls. How about the guy The New York times hired this pollster, this great genius. He never called one wrong. I dont know. Three, 46.. I dont know what the hell  Its called three 40  Whats his deal 00. We were given a very tiny chance. What chance did he give us Like 9%, something like that. You know, they gave him millions of dollars shortly before, because he never called one wrong. He called that one wrong. He called that one wrong. And this is the one  I mean, I must tell you theyre a little more accurate. At least here they have us even in a lot of places.  Hes even. Well, were not even, were not even. This is going to be the greatest victory. This is a more important election than four years ago, Ill tell you, more important. Because at no time before, has there been a clearer choice between two parties or two visions, two philosophies, two agendas for the future. Theres never been anything like this. On November 3rd, Nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, like we had. We had the greatest economy in the history  not of our country, in the world. We were beating everybody. We were beating China. Remember, if you go back, some of you go back, if you go back 10 years, 15 years, five years, everything was  In 2019, China will overtake the United States as the largest economy. And that didnt work out too well for them. That didnt work out. We were just doing leaps and bounds. We were doing so great, and then we got hit with the plague, the China plague. And were not thrilled. Its a disgrace. Nobody should have died. Nobody should have died. We got hit. The whole world got hit, but they stopped it from going into the rest of China. They stopped it from going into China, but they didnt stop it from coming into the US and Europe and 188 countries. So whether or not we allow Biden to impose the biggest tax increase in the history of our country, 4 trillion, or ban  He wants to ban energy, ban American  He wants to stop fracking. Hey, by the way, when he was running as a Democrat, in the worst debate performances Ive ever seen. Okay What do you think  He was unable to answer anything. Are you awake, sir Sir, please wake up. And who was the worst Who treated him the worst Kamala. Kamala. Shes another beauty. She started off as a favorite. She was at 15. Then she went down to 14, to 12, to 10. She was like a dropping rock in water. She was going down so fast. Then she went down to five and four and three, two, and then she said, I got to get the hell out of here. This is getting embarrassing. And nobody treated him worse than Kamala. Right She called him a racist. She called him everything. She was horrible to him. And he says, She was Kamala. Shes just great. Oh, yeah. These people, these people. Youre supposed to choose the people that did well. She got out before Iowa, as I remember. Right She didnt want to run in Iowa, and then Bernie got  Again, this guy is the greatest loser ever because- No, no. No, hes a good sport, Bernie, crazy Bernie. Hes so crazy, but hes a good sport, because with Hillary, they really did. Do we have any young children here I know its on a lot of television. Could you turn the television off just for a minute, just for about three seconds He got screwed. Right Okay. Now you can turn it back on. But then they really did with this last one, because if Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, if she would have left the race one day before the big Super Tuesday, I mean, Bernie would have her philosophy, right Liberals. And I would say, shell be president. If he ever wants, shell be president within the first month or so, I would say. I think its just an excuse. Using him as just an excuse to get the super libs in there, so they can destroy our suburbs, demolish our Second Amendment, erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous, anti-American lies in school. So under my leadership, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now were doing it again. Were doing it again. Youve seen the numbers. And were developing a vaccine in record time. It will be ready before the end of the year and maybe much sooner than that. Theyre very unhappy about that. Its amazing. We have a couple of really great experts, one whos  We call him Dr. Scott. You know who Im talking about Hes great. He said, this is the only time  They were grilling him on television, saying, Well, the vaccines going too fast. You know why thats too fast Because they dont want it to happen before the election. He said, This is the only thing in the world. Ive never seen anything like it. Everybody wants a vaccine. And when we start getting it fast, because President Trump happens to be president   and weve done this in record time, years ahead of schedule. If this was Sleepy Joe and Obama, you wouldnt have a vaccine for three years. But listen, he said, This is the craziest thing. So youre going to have a vaccine quickly. Right And everybodys upset about it. So now theyre trying to hurt the vaccine. And theyre trying to say as many bad  They know nothing about it, but theyre trying to hurt it, and its a shame. But he said it better than anybody Ive heard. He said, Youre trying to hurt this country by saying bad things about the vaccine, because were going to produce it early. Its the craziest thing. Think about it. Now, having a vaccine is good, but were rounding the turn regardless. Were rounding the turn, and its happening. I mean, its happening. You see. Florida is way down. Texas is now way down. Arizona, governors done a great job. All three governors have done a great job. And Louisiana now, they had a spike, but they had the spike, but the spike was able to be handled, because now we understand. And what we did, we saved millions of lives, because I hated to do it, but we had to close it up, understand this disease, and then open up again. And we opened, but we would have had 2 million, two and a half, or three million people. Think of it. Were at like around 180,000. One is too many. One, too many. But we wouldve had two and a half, three, three and a half million people. It would not have been acceptable, would not have been sustainable. Weve done an incredible job. And these people that have done it with me, the ventilators, the vaccines, the therapeutics, these people  I mean the hospitals, the beds that we built, the ships that we sent to New York, the ships that we sent. To have an ungrateful governor in New York, Cuomo, to have an ungrateful governor. We sent him ships. We sent them ships. We sent them. We built a convention center with 2,800 beds, and he didnt use the beds for senior citizens. He hardly used the beds at all. He hardly used the ships at all. He said we did a phenomenal job, and now he gets political. He wants to get political with me. A real wise guy, but thats okay. You got to see what they are doing between him and de Blasio. Thats a beauty. What theyve done to my beautiful city. I love that city so much. What theyve done is so horrible. The highest taxes in the land, crime all over the place. Theyre like 300% up in crime. We need Rudy to come out of retirement. But were defeating the China virus. When Biden was vice president, he was a complete disaster on the swine flu, which was a much easier thing to handle. Joe Bidens own chief of staff said that when Biden managed swine flu in 2009, they quote, Did every possible thing wrong. This is the guy that worked for him in charge of the swine flu. And 60 million Americans got H1N1 in a period of time. And its just purely a  He said it was just  we were lucky. He said, Its just lucky that there werent great mass casualties. Different kinds of a disease, a little bit. And what he said is amazing. He said we did nothing right. This is the man thats going to tell us all about building ventilators. You think Joe is going to be able to build thousands of ventilators a month Which now were doing, and sending them to all these countries, all over the world, who have no hope of building ventilators, and they need them badly. So its an amazing thing. The outbreak was so rampant that Obama-Biden, the administration, told States to stop testing immediately, and they ordered the CDC to stop counting cases because they looked like hell, okay We didnt do that. By the way, the reason we show so many cases, because we have the best testing program in the world, by far, by far. Bidens record demonstrates that if he had been in charge when the China virus arrived, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. As vice president, he presided over the worst and the weakest and the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. Youve heard that before. It was the most pathetic recovery since the Depression. No state was hit harder by Bidens failure than Nevada. And I was out here and that right about that. You got hit hard. This is not the guy you want. But Biden wants to raise your taxes so high. He would eradicate your economy. Hed put on new regulations, and it wouldnt be him again. Im going to keep saying it. It will be the people that control him. Hes a puppet. And then he wants to do a complete shutdown. Were setting records. We just set a job record for four months, 10.4 million people. Listen to this. So when we had this pandemic worldwide, look, its a terrible thing that a thing like this happened. People were saying we could go to 41, 42% unemployment. You know what we are now 8.4%. I dont say thats  If you would have said that  And we have the strongest, highest stock market in history, so your 401ks are doing great. If he got in, we would have the greatest depression in the history of our country. I mean it. I think 1929 would look like good times. All right Because hed do everything wrong. Hed raise your taxes. Hed raised the hell out of interest rates. Hed do everything wrong. The Biden shutdown will permanently destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of Americans, inflict totally lasting harm on our children and lead countless deaths from suicide. Dont forget when you do these shutdowns, your state is shut down. You got a governor. You shut down, except if you have a riot. Youre not shut down for riots. Riots, you can have, they can burn the hell out of the Strip. They can burn the hell out of Reno. They can do whatever the hell they want if its a riot. But if you want to go to church, you cant do it. If you want to be in a group of people, you cant do it. But theres a lot of harm done on the other side. Theres a lot of tremendous harm done. Remember, the cure cant be worse. Remember that. And on the other side, drugs, suicide, depression, substance abuse of different kinds, heart disease. You have tremendous problems on the other side. Open your schools, open up. We got to open up this state. And I guarantee you  And by the way, the states that are open are doing really well. Theyre doing much better than the ones that are closed. I dont know if youve been seeing the numbers. And this is just arithmetic. The states that are open are doing great. The states that are closed, North Carolina, what hes doing to that great state, hes got it locked down, shut down. Michigan, what shes doing. And were trying to get Big 10 football by the way, but we wont even. Michigan, what shes doing to Michigan is unbelievable. Take a look at what theyre doing to Pennsylvania. And heres another governor in charge of millions of ballots. So Im going to win Pennsylvania, but whats he going to do with these ballots Where are they going Who are they sending Whos sending it back Whos signing They dont even have to have an authorized signature in Nevada. Do you know that They dont have to have  You dont have to have an authorized signature on a ballot No. Theyre trying to rig an election, and we cant let that happen. I hope youre all going to be poll-watchers, I hope you are, because with you people watching the polls, its going to be pretty hard to cheat. Ill tell you, I wouldnt want to be a cheater. Theyll figure a way. No, they are. Its a very dangerous thing. Its a very dangerous thing, and I totally mean it. And Ive been at it. And you see people. And by the way, its not even politics. Its common sense. They said millions of ballots. People are getting ballots. People died and theyre getting ballots. Theyre sending them to dogs. You see that Dogs got ballot. Everybodys getting ballots. Probably everybody, but Republican are going to get the ballots. Right And theyre unsolicited. So when you say, solicited, because I like solicited better as a word than absentee. Absentee, nobody knows what the hell its supposed to represent. Its not really a good definition. One is solicited, where you ask  You solicit the ballot. You want it, you sign papers. They send it to you. You send it back. Its okay. Its good. But unsolicited, where they take millions of ballots. So what happens I happen to think the postal people are great, but what happens if one of the post guys, before he gives the ballots, he takes a whole handful and hands them to some Democrat political operative, right And so, he hands him a thousand ballots, and the guy doesnt even have to  you dont have to have verification to do that. Now, heres the good news. Were in front of a court. And hopefully, the courts going to rule, because this is the greatest scam in the history of presidential politics. These people are  theyve gone crazy. Biden and his party of liberal hypocrites want to lock law-abiding Americans in their homes, which is what theyre doing. And they want to keep them out of church. They really do. Theyre fighting God, theyre fighting guns, and theyre fighting oil. Think of it. I dont think theyll do too well in Texas. Did you see where they said We think the race will be quite close in Texas, but the president has an edge. Listen, Im in favor of oil and energy. Im in favor of religion and God. Okay And Im in favor of our great Second Amendment, guns. So hes against our Second Amendment. Okay, you know who hed put in charge. Beto, Beto. Or as he says is, Beto, Beto. So when Beto was legit and then Ted Cruz beat him, and Ted did a very good job. I tell you, he did a great job. But Beto went totally south. Hes gone crazy. So he now is a big gun guy. He wants to take guns away from everybody. So who did Biden put in charge Beto. Remember Beto was interviewed in some magazine or third-rate magazine, most of them are, but remember And Beto said, this was at the beginning before he got beat to hell. I said, He thought this was easy, didnt he But remember when Beto said, I was born for this. As soon as I hear somebodys born for running for president, I said, Hes out. Thats the end of him. Nobodys born for this. This is tough stuff. I had a great life, Ill tell you. My life was so beautiful. What the hell did I do this for But you know what You know what We are doing things that nobodys ever done before. And I say it all the time, and thats what makes me happy. Were dealing with very sick and very bad and evil people. But Ill tell you no administration in three-and-a-half years, no administration has done what weve done in the first three-and-a-half years. But they want to punish you for praying in church while they let agitators and arsonists burn your churches down. Look at Washington. They want to burn the churches down, and thats fine. But you want to go pray in church, they wont let you do that. Just last week, Biden proudly accepted the endorsement of pro-criminal, anti-police, Portland district attorney, who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals, and violent extremists without any charges. No charges. Never saw anything. By the way, all of these places were talking about are Democrat- run, Chicago, New York, Portland, Seattle. The only reason Seattle got settled, because they knew we were going in. We told them, were going in tomorrow morning. Were going to open it up. Were going to take it. It would have taken us 20 minutes. So they sent people that night, because they didnt want to be embarrassed. But look at what weve done. And so, every place weve touched, we solved the crime, but they have to ask us. If they dont ask us, were not supposed to do it, but maybe we do it anyway. And it usually takes anywhere from 25 minutes to  And it usually takes anywhere from 25 minutes to about one hour. Wasnt that a beautiful sight though in Minneapolis, right Theyre burning the poor city down. I love that state. I think we have a chance of winning in that state, first time in many years for a Republican. Theyre burning Minneapolis. You dont think of Minneapolis that way, right You dont think of it. The city is burning down. You have this fake CNN reporter, whats his name Velshi, the nice shaved head. Maybe I should try that, should I try that No, I dont think   Donald Trump went down substantially in the polls, like about 40%. He showed up with a new haircut, its called the shave head. Ali Velshi. And remember he said, No, this is a friendly protest. Its a friendly protest. And its really quite nice. And people are throwing bottles at him, hes being hit with tear gas. This is a friendly protest. And you look over his shoulder and the entire city was burning. Do you remember the scene The thing looked like it was 30 blocks, it was just burning. And hes talking about, this is all fake news and nobody would have known. I knew it before I did it, but I never knew it to this extent. I never knew it to this extent. It is corrupt. Its fake and they shouldnt be allowed to do it. They shouldnt be allowed. These are far left lunatics that Biden selects to staff his government. There are policies Bidens pledged to apply nationwide. Youre going to have the suburbs, they have a plan. It doesnt matter, its a regulation, very horrible regulation for the  Does anybody live in the suburbs Because if you dont vote for Trump in the suburbs, okay. Women that live in the suburbs. They say, Oh, they dont like Donald Trump. I said, I think they do. Remember last time, remember its the same thing. No, its the same thing. Remember, last time, four years ago, Donald Trump will not do well with women. I said, Why am I so bad Donald Trump will not  And then the votes started coming in. Hes doing very well, Jim, with women, I dont know whats going on. We did very well with women. We did well with everybody, we did well with everybody. But they have a regulation. And Ben Carson was fantastic, the head of HUD. I said, Ben, theyre going to destroy the suburbs. And they wanted Corey Booker to head that program. But the program was already doing damage. They were playing with the zoning so they could build projects in the suburb, projects in the suburbs. And I said, Were going to end it. Somebody said, Sir, lets just amend it. I said, Nope, we got to end it. End it, I want to end it. I dont want to have a lesser version. But if he gets in, they will open up that whole program. Theyre going to open it up on steroids. Theyre going to open it up to a level that you wouldnt have believed possible. And he will drive you out of the suburbs. He will drive you out of the  hell drive you out of everything. Theyre open up their  I call it the suburban destruction program because thats what theyve done. And its been a horrible program. Its been very unfair to people with the American dream. And let me just tell you something. 30% of the people that live in the suburbs are minorities. Theyre Hispanic, theyre Black, theyre Asian, its the American dream. And they want the American dream and they dont want that to happen. Thats why Im doing so well with African American, with Asian American, with Hispanic American and with women. But dont let them ruin the suburbs because they will put that regulation back immediately, immediately. And dont let them ruin the suburbs because the suburbs are a special place. The suburbs are the American dream. Thats where everyone aspires to and that includes minorities and everybody. Dont let them ruin the suburbs. And with that comes tremendous crime. And I was talking the other day, Darling, somebody just moved next door. Who is it Its a representative of Antifa. She will look at her husband, say, Darling, were out of here. Were out of here. Antifa. Remember they were trying to blame other people. They dont like to mention the name Antifa. I said, its Antifa and I was right. I was right. Theyre bad people. And you know what, they have to pay a price for the damage and for the horror that theyve caused, they have to pay a price. And its so easy. Its so easy. A lot of them now are wealthy. Theyre like these wealthy, spoiled kids that have no clue about life. Theyve got arms that are about this big but they were heavy jackets with lots  and you look and you say, Oh, that guy looks tough. And then the jacket comes off and you see these two little  And they go home and they live in a basement too, their mom and dads basement. But Bidens plan is to appease domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists. Joe Biden is a weak person. He does whatever his left wing, puppet masters demand, you know that. Look, Joe doesnt know whats going on, you know that. I mean, lets be nice about it, okay. And Im being nice when I say it. Hell never be able to protect your family, your loved ones or your community. If Bidens elected his radical supporters wont just cause mayhem on the streets like youre seeing, all Democrats. We could solve it so fast. Chicago, a few weekends, think of it, 72 people shot, this is shot. Somebody said, You mean with bullets I said, Yeah, with bullets. 18 people died. Now were pulling our troops out of Afghanistan, out of Iraq, you see whats happening. But let me tell you but we dont  theres nothing like that over there. They dont have 18 people killed or 12 people in a short period of time. Well, you have 70 people shot, where you have another weekend where they had, I think a few weekends ago, 38 people have been shot in Chicago. I said, 38 Its not even believable. And now when these people say it, they make it  they try and play it down. And youre sitting there, I said, Did I just see 38 people were shot Its just a terrible thing. And it could all be stopped. It could all be stopped so quickly. But they have to respect law and they have to have order. Law and order. But these radical lefts will be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Supreme Court. And you see whats going on there. If we dont  The next president, hopefully its going to be us, not me, us, but the next president is going to have one, two, three or four Supreme Court justice. Its just, you know, just that time, right Just that time, going to be a minimum of one, I would say, but it will be a one, two, three or four. And thats going to change the whole makeup of the Supreme Court. Thats going to take away your guns. Thats going to destroy your second amendment. Thats going to change the whole rationale thinking on so many different subjects like you wouldnt believe, including by the way, life, okay. Life, pro-life, anybody pro-life here No, this is going to change the makeup of this country for 50 years. I dont know that the country will survive 50 years, if that happens, it might not survive five years if that happens. But the next president and you saw, I put out a list of an additional number of very conservative, highly thought of, highly respected judges. And they are the only people that I will pick. Meaning the first list, the second list, its about 44, 45 people. They are the only people that I will consider for the Supreme Court of the United States. And Im asking Joe Biden to do the same thing, but he cant because hes got a bunch of radical left maniacs that they want to put on the court. And nobody can get elected, not even with Democrats, rational Democrats, will they vote for some of these people to be on. So far hes refused to do it. Im probably forcing him tonight to do something, but he should put out a list of his judges so that you know where you stand. Biden supports cutting police funding, you know that, abolishing  and by the way, did you see, we just got Chicago police today endorsed Trump. Thats not easy to do. Chicago. New Yorks finest, New Yorks finest endorse, Florida, Ohio, Texas. We have everybody. Is there a police officer in the country, if there is, theyll do a commercial. This officer loves sleepy Joe Biden, hes so tough on crime. So Bidens been going down very rapidly in the polls. And now what hes doing is hes playing tough guy, that hes tough on crime. And all of a sudden, he goes from demolished, demolish and defund, okay But he goes from, lets not give the police any money. Lets not even say defund for him. His people want to defund the police. They actually have places, Seattle, they actually dont want to have police. Minneapolis, they dont want to have police. They dont want to have police. Whats going to happen You saw the commercial we put up. A womans being murdered. Im sorry. We cannot take your call right now. We will call you back within the next 24 hours. A womans being raped, right Im sorry. We could not respond right now because we have been defunded, but we will try getting there within the next week. This is what youre going to have. I mean, that was a strong commercial. It had a big impact, but this is what youre buying with a guy like this. This guy youre going to have Portlands all over this country. And we cant allow that to happen. Not here, he says, Not here in Nevada. Well with your governor, it could happen here too, I can tell. They want to abolish bail. So they want to abolish cash bail like they did in New York. They release people, the horrible criminals in New York, they release them, no cash bail. And he calls law enforcement, Biden called law enforcement the enemy. Theyre not the enemy. Theyre our friends. Theyre our great friends. And without them, we wouldnt be here. Here in Nevada rioters burned the city hall in Reno. Does anybody know that Do you know that Thats not a pleasant sight. How did you allow that to happen I wouldve thought you people wouldve gotten out there, like, Youre not going to burn our city hall. And during the violent demonstrations in Las Vegas a 29- year-old police officer, you know about this, was deliberately shot in the head while he was doing his job, a vicious criminal left, he was a left person, a left. He was a real left, all right. And the, the young officer as you know, hes a young, brilliant, young guy and hes totally paralyzed. Unlike Biden, while Im President of the United States, I will always stand with the heroes of our law enforcement. And on November 3rd, you will save America. Youre talking about saving America. We cannot let this happen to our country. Because I dont know if you can ever come back from what will happen, including our Supreme Court. Were joined tonight by our terrific Republican congressional nominee, who has my complete and total endorsement. Jim, where you Jim Jim Marchant, Jim Marchant, where are you A lot of people out there, Jim, its not easy. Are you doing well I just looked at a very solid poll. Jim Marchant is a great guy and hopefully hes going to win and youre going to carry them over and you need it, you need it. Thank you, Jim. And also to a man that should have been governor. He should have been governor, what happened I dont know what happened. Nevada Attorney General, hes a great guy, Adam Laxalt. And hes watching very closely.

How are we doing, Michael Are we leading, I hope Okay. I hear were doing well. Be careful of the ballots, thats the only way were going to lose. Cant have this happen to our country. And also here are several really great members of a terrific association and they like Trump a lot, the Nevada Trucking Association. Where are they, Nevada Trucking Nevada Trucking, thank you, thank you. Thank you, fellas, thank you very much. Great job, we appreciate it very much. Those roads are going to get very nice. Theyre already starting. Tonight our hearts are with all of the communities in the West battling devastating wildfires. Im going there the day after tomorrow. Im staying in your state tonight, but Im going to be going to California. Spoke to the folks in Oregon, Washington, they never had anything like this, but it is about forest management. Please remember the words, very simple, forest management, please remember. Its about forest management and other things but forest management. My administration is closely coordinating with state and local leaders and we want to thank the more than 200,000 people that are working on it and 28,000 firefighters and first responders who courageously and bravely are fighting out there. They are fighting and its dangerous, its dangerous. Its rapidly spreading, hundreds of thousands of acres, its not been anything quite like this one. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the past 47 years. Think of it, hes been there 47 years. And he always says, Well, why didnt you do this Why did  The guy just really in all fairness, Ive been here three and a half years. So its not like they havent been here. He was a vice president for eight years and he only did one thing good. He treated Obama good. I was going to say something else, but they would have scolded me. Thats exactly what I was going to say, but I didnt. Its better than you say it. Do you want to shout it out Go ahead, shout. Thats what I said, thats what I was  thank you very  This can only happen in Nevada. And we pass record tax cuts and regulation cuts to keep the family farms and ranches in the family. Nobody even knows this. We virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax. Does anyone have a small farm, medium-sized farm or business Anybody If you want to leave it to your children, you dont have to pay tax now because of Trump. I always say it and I mean it, if you like your children, its great. If you dont like your children, it doesnt mean a damn thing, dont leave it to them. I ended the administrations  and if you look at that last administration, what they were doing on American energy, what they were doing, and now we are the worlds number one energy producer by far and we are energy independent. How about your gas prices Thats not too bad, right You didnt think youd ever see those prices, those under two dollar prices, did you Thank you President Trump, I appreciate it, sir. Biden has pledged to abolish the production of American oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas, and he wants to ban fracking, right So hes in these debates with the other people and theyre just eating him alive. He did his best debate against crazy Bernie and I got to ask, why did he get better, all of a sudden What happened Why, do you have any idea why I think I know. Why did he get better all of a sudden But he did his last event, but he was so bad. And he raised his hand, no fracking. There will be no fracking under my administration, he said. And you know why I add the word, he said, because they will take what I said and they will put it as a commercial. There will be no fracking under my administration, theyll have me saying that. Thats how dishonest these people are. So I always have to add something because  but even then sometimes theyll cut it off at the end. But he said, therell be no fracking under my administration. Now, all of a sudden he goes to Pennsylvania and his polls arent looking very good because they do big fracking. And he goes to Texas and he goes to Oklahoma and he goes to North Dakota and he goes to all these places. Its not looking so good. All of a sudden he says, I have nothing against fracking. What are you talking about But always follow their first instinct because the first instinct is what is going to happen. And he has to, because he signed  he has a manifesto. I call it the manifesto with Bernie and AOC plus three, all these crazy people. And its a manifesto and it reads far worse than anything Bernie Sanders ever said. I thought hed take what Bernie did and move them somewhat to the right. No, he took what Bernie said and they moved way further left. Its the craziest thing Ive ever seen. But follow the original statements because thats whats going to happen. And they cannot  you know solar, I like solar, but solar is very expensive and it doesnt have the power to fire up our massive plants. We have big plants, including in this great state and you cant fire them up with this stuff. You cant fire it. We need the strength because were competing against a lot of nations and they dont go through what we do. They dont care about the air and they should, and they should, which is another problem. I took you out of that crazy Paris Climate Accord, because it was totally disaster. No, it was a way of hurting the United States. I tell you, we would have had a close 20, 25% of our factories in order to even  it was so crazy, so expensive but I took you out. I was surprised people, most people, they appreciate what I did. Because you think it was easy doing that It was actually, I thought it would be devastating. I got one day of bad press, after that, everybody forgot about it. It wasnt that bad. But I did the right thing for our country and we want to have our great plants working. We want to have our great plants fired up. They said manufacturing jobs are dead, right Sleepy Joe said, Im going to bring back manufacturing. Really Well, Obama said, youd need a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 650,000 jobs. He said youd need a miracle. And now sleepy Joe is saying that, no, no, no. Ive got to bring back  Hes not going to bring back anything. I made history by signing an executive order making the official policy of the United States government to buy American and to hire American. Now I did this long time ago. And then I see a sign in front of Joe right here, right here, it said, buy American. Oh great, Joe, thanks, Joe. Where have you been for 47 years Because for 47 years, Joe Biden did the opposite. He crushed the dreams of American workers and enriched foreign countries. Thats how China happened. Hey, look what Ive done. Ive taken billions, tens of billions of dollars out of China. Nobody else did it before me, I mean, no other president. In all fairness, in all fairness to Obama and Biden, I call him, Obiden because its easier, Obiden. In all fairness to Obiden, I mean, they didnt do any of that. But now I see buy American. Hey, he also copied on the pandemic. Did you see he copied everything I was doing Except one thing, he wouldnt have closed the country to China so hundreds of thousands of people would have died from that. But two months, two and a half months later, he admitted that I was right. Thank you very much, Joe, I appreciate it. And yesterday he made, I think he made a mistake. Well, what do you think, the USMCA, whats better that or NAFTA Well, no, the USMCA is better. Was that Jake Tapper I like Jake Tapper, was that  I dont think he was doing  I dont think he likes me too much, but thats okay. They said whats better, they said, whats better. He goes, USMCA. Well, thats the deal that Trump made. Oh, it is Oh. Thats a great deal we made. We took the horrible NAFTA deal. We got rid of the NAFTA. We got rid of TPP. We got rid of that terrible, terrible South Korea deal, which Hillary Clinton said, will produce 250,000 jobs. She said, this will produce 200  she made it. Hillary, crooked Hillary. She made it, no wait, she said its going to produce 250,000 jobs. And she was 100% right, it produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea, not for us. It produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea. Not for us. South Korea did very well with that deal, but I changed that deal a lot. Thats now a good deal. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers. When we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. Youre not going to see companies leaving for Mexico very much anymore. Theyre not going to be leaving your community, going to Mexico, making a product, selling the product back in, not being taxed at the border. Doesnt work that way anymore. Its probably the biggest reason I ran for president if you want to know that and these stupid, endless wars. I saved the Uni- but thats one of the reasons Washington doesnt like me. They love those endless wars. You got to ask them, Why Do you ever watch where theyre very critical of me. I mean, We dont like him on foreign policy. Really Look what Ive done. Look what Ive done. Israel Were signing deals all over the place. These guys that are lecturing all the time, they dont have a clue. Theyre clueless. They were clueless. Thats why for 40 years you got nothing except blood in the sand. Thats all you got. Blood in the sand. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from last administrations job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to Chinas rampant theft of American jobs. They dont like me too much. Joe Bidens agenda is, Made in China. My agenda is, Made in the USA. Thats the way. For the last four years, Ive been delivering for our incredible Hispanic I love a Hispanic community. Oh, there was a poll today. Did you see it Did you see the poll Oh, this was a biggie. They had a poll today that with the Hispanic voter, they call them Latino, Hispanic. They use different terms. To me, I just loved the people. I dont care, but let me just Did you see it Trump is leading Biden with the Hispanic community. Trump is leading Biden. Well, Hispanics like tough people. They like people that are going to produce jobs. They like And by the way, the Hispanics understand the border better than anybody else. Theyre better than anybody else. No, but were being you know, its unusual that a Republican would be leading a Democrat, not its habit. You know what the problem is, its habit. But the Hispanics get it. And were leading with the Hispanic community. And thats because you had the lowest job numbers in the history of our country. You had the best home ownership. Every statistic was the best. And now were doing it again, except were doing it very rapidly. Remember 8.4%. We could have been at 44%, if stupid people ran it, 8.4%. Im fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods, low taxes and regulations on Hispanic-owned, small businesses. Were fighting. You know, the Hispanic-owned, small businesses, theyre great business people. I know it from being in business. They were very tough. They were great business people and they get it. They get it like very few people get it. Im also standing up for religious liberty. Joe Biden would be So Joe Biden would be a disaster for all communities, not just the Hispanic communities, pledged to wage attacks on Catholic organizations, like the Little Sisters of the Poor that were helping. And were winning with them. Were helping them. They got hit so hard by Oh Biden. They got hit so hard. I remember them in the Supreme Court, the Little Sisters of the Poor. They get hit by Biden. And then he says, How wonderful. Hes such a wonderful person. He supports taxpayer-funded, extreme, late-term abortion. And I mean, ninth month, ninth month, ninth month. And hed allow violent mobs to burn down your business. And he would hand your country over to the socialists. But I believe its worse than socialists. I do. I think its a step worse than socialist. And it starts with a C. That is why were going to win a record share of the Hispanic vote in November. So important. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Its so important. Were bringing it back very fast. I think next year is Next year, I believe will be as good or better than the year we had last year. Unless somebody comes in and decides to quadruple your taxes, then I cant. Then all bets are off, but were going to have Were lowering taxes. Hes raising taxes. Were going to have tremendous growth. Joe Bidens party continues to attack our incredible border agents. Theyre incredible people, more than half of whom happen to be Hispanic-Americans. Did you know that I know all of them. Jose, how you doing Juan, how you doing Every sixth time, Id say, Hello, Jim, how are you These extraordinary patriots deserve our admiration, gratitude and respect, not Joe Bidens contempt. Hes got contempt for these people that are so great and brave. Thats a tough job. My administrations achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended the catch and release disaster. Remember youd catch somebody, Whats your name I dont know. Whats your address I dont know. Okay. Go into our country. Thats okay. You couldnt arrest anybody. We ended it, stopped asylum fraud and weve deported over 20,000 gang members, including MS13 and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens. Now think about it. Think of that number. Think if you at a half a million people spread throughout the country that were criminal, illegal aliens. Some of these are very violent people and we get them the hell out. Were stopping human trafficking, protecting the victims, most of whom are women, most of whom are women. Human trafficking because of the internet thats a tremendously big and horrible business. These are the worst human beings of all. But most of the victims are women, children to a much lesser extent, but women and human traffickers. And you know what made it that way is the internet. Who would think It almost sounds like an ancient crime. Its not. Its very modern because of the internet because of the computer. And its a horrible thing and weve stopped so much of it. We have an incredible group of people that go after these animals. And we built now over 320 miles of border wall and are adding 10 new miles a week. And the wall will very soon be finished. Itll be finished. Weve invested 2.5 trillion in the US military. Weve rebuilt our depleted It was a depleted military. Now we have the newest, we have the best weve ever had and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in nearly 75 years, the US Space Force. And we did things that people said couldnt be done. After 52 years, we passed VA Choice in VA Accountability and 91% of our veterans now approve of their VA care. They think its doing great. The fact is I did more in 47 months as president than Joe Biden did in 47 years. Its true. Its true. I withdrew from last administrations disastrous Iran nuclear deal. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We eliminated the worlds number one terrorist and mass murderer of American troops, Qasem Soleimani. Hes dead. Hes gone. Biden voted for the Iraq War. He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development. Oh, really Tell me about it. Tell me about it. Not too positive. Joe Biden has been on the wrong side of history for 47 years. In fact, the secretary of state, secretary of defense said about him, Hes never called it right. He never called it right. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would right now have died. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. You know that, especially with ventilators and equipment and masks and shields. Were delivering life-saving therapies that have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. And you dont hear that from the fake news. Europes excess mortality rate is 24% higher. And these are statistics that come from people that do this stuff, right This is not done by my secretary. 24% higher than the United States and despite their punitive lockdowns, theyre once again seeing a spike. Theyre seeing a big spike in cases over there. They did the heavy lockdowns, just like youre doing right here. And theyre seeing a spike. And theres no reason for that. The United States has experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation. Think of that. And by far, the fastest recovery. And if they wrote about it properly, it would be a proper thing, a proper thing to do. Through our historic relief programs, weve saved more than half a trillion Nevada cops and jobs and all of this yet. So many people going out. Weve saved 42,000 Nevada businesses. Think of that. Biden would terminate this comeback. He wants to end it. He would terminate this comeback. He would put your families in danger. He will totally destroy Social Security. And in my opinion, if you look at what hes going to do to Medicare, they will destroy Social Security. They will. You called it. You know what youre talking about Exactly, right. Hes going to massively raise your taxes. Reimpose crippling federal regulations, destroy your Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. Hes going to destroy that and decimate your 401ks and retirement savings and stocks. Your stocks are going to go down like you never saw anything go down before. Hell obliterate your Second Amendment. Hell give you And he would, he would give free He wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens that will bankrupt Medicare. He wants to give You saw him raise his hand. Remember the debate where theyre all standing there and he looked around, Whos going to give free healthcare to illegal aliens And everyones raising hands. Hes going, Oh Now take a look. Im not kidding. Its sad. Its pathetic. He would end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions 700%, opening the flood gates to terror-afflicted nations. You understand that. Hell establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal, illegal aliens. He loves sanctuary cities, meaning the people that control him love sanctuary cities. Biden, pledges to oppose school choice. And he has stated that if he is elected charter schools are gone. Theyre gone. In the second term, and weve already started it very heavily, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and a limitless future for all Americans. Instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that weve been through and weve been through more than any president has ever been through with these characters and theyre falling one after another. But you do notice that I hope. One after another. Oh, I see the phones have been wiped out. I wonder what thats all about, but thats a criminal thing you did. We are changing Washington. We are changing Washington. Never forget that theyre coming after me because I am fighting for you. And its true. Over the next four years to conclude, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring economies and a record prosperity, even greater than last year. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices, and believe We will believe in enforcing the law. We want law and order. We have to have it. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars. And we are bringing our troops home as we speak tonight. We will maintain Americas unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. Its already signed, starts on January 1st. I dont want anyone to I know ours is a big deal. I dont want Sleepy Joe to take care of Can you imagine Ill be watching. Prices have dropped substantially all throughout the country because of price And Im the one that got it done. And hell say, What did I do What did I do How did this happen And well further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We just did favored nations. Were going to come down to the lowest price anywhere in the world because we did a favored nations clause. You know what that is We will The drug companies dont exactly like me too much. Theyre spending millions of dollars on negative commercials. Please understand when you see those commercials, it means your drug prices are coming down. We will strongly protect Medicaid and Social Security, which they will give up. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. And we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Nevada. So very importantly, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and get out and vote on November 3rd. From Carson City to Elko, from Las Vegas to Reno and from Clark County to right here in Douglas County, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty. They want to secure our liberty. Think of it and defend our freedom. Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys, innovators and trailblazers, tough people, great people who tamed the frontier, raised up the mighty Hoover Dam, lit up the brilliant lights of the Vegas Strip and transformed a sprawling desert into a shining oasis. So true. Our American ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth. And we are making it greater than it ever has been. We are making it greater than ever before. We are making it greater than its ever been. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. Were going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Nevada, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much."
NewHampshire,Feb10,2020,"Hello, Manchester, and I am thrilled to be in the great state of New Hampshire with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family, and country. Thank you. Thank you. And Ill tell you what  we have more in this arena, and I hate to say this to you we have more than this outside of the arena trying to get in. So if youd like to give up your seat or where youre standing Sorry we couldnt get you seats, but if you want to give it up, let them come in, you go out. Does anybody want to make that deal I dont think so. But we have more in this arena and outside of this arena than all of the other candidates, meaning the Democrats, put together and multiplied times fave. And the fake news, these guys will never report that. Theyll never report it. They dont even like showing the crowd. They always show my face. They never show the crowd. But you know what The people can hear the crowd. The people can hear the crowd. They know. That is not the sound of 200 people. One of their prime candidates today, they worked a big deal. They had exactly 104 people, and the fake news said, It was a nice crowd. Very nice. If I had one empty seat here, one empty seat in this massive arena, theyd say, He didnt sell out. But you know what We have never had an empty seat from the day your future first lady and I came down the escalator. Never, not one time. And we have the biggest arenas in the country. With your help on November 3rd we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats. We are going to win New Hampshire in a landslide. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy weve ever had, the most prosperity. We have got the most prosperity weve ever had. By the way, were going to keep it that way, too, if its okay, who was mumbling, very distracting, very distracting. Its true. You know, it was very distracting. Im speaking and a woman is mumbling terribly behind me, angry. There was a little anger back there. Were the ones that should be angry, not them. Were the ones that should be angry, but we proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. Our country is stronger today than ever before. And the day after my address, our good Republicans in the United States Senate voted to reject the outrageous partisan impeachment hoax and to issue a full, complete, and absolute, total acquittal. And it ,wasnt even close and I want to thank our Republican senators and our Republican House members. They were tremendous. In the House, we won 196 to nothing and then we got three Democrats. And in the Senate, other than Romney, we got 52 to nothing, 52 to nothing. Thats something, and in one case we got 53 to nothing, but I dont even count that to be honest. The radical lefts pathetic partisan crusade has completely failed and utterly backfired with 18 votes think of that 18 votes to spare, with a lot of votes to spare. And also very importantly, as of today, I we, because its not we. Its not I. Its we. Were all in this together. We have the highest poll numbers that we have ever had. Thank you, Nancy, very much. Thank you. While the extreme left has been wasting Americas time with this vile hoax, weve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our borders, and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. From our rural communities to our cities, we are expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens. We added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. Amazing. And I listened. I watched. I had all these experts. They were saying, Yes, I think 60,000. Another one said 101,000. Another one said 125. Another one was 118. And then the number came out, 225,000. Pretty good. Pretty good. We have destroyed the ISIS caliphate. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS. Al-Baghdadi is dead. Al-Baghdadi is dead, and we just took out the worlds top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. The fact is, America is respected again. Its been a long time. But as we keep on winning, Washington democrats keep on losing their minds. Theyre crazy. Thats why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement. Theyre joining our great Republican party. Now, I cant tell you whats happening tomorrow because you know you have some pretty strange election laws here, right Remember last time We won the primary tremendously. We should have won the election, but they had buses being shipped up from Massachusetts, hundreds and hundreds of buses. And it was very, very close even though they did, but this year we have a great governor, Governor Sununu. Great governor, Chris. And now you get prosecuted if you do what they did, so it should be a lot different. But we have done great. This has been an incredible state for us. Its a state where the people are great, just great people. And we hear that there could be because you have crossovers in primaries, dont you So I hear a lot of Republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the Democrats. Does that make sense You people wouldnt do that. My only problem is Im trying to figure out who is their weakest candidate I think theyre all weak if you want to know the truth. We proudly welcome and embrace voters of all parties and political persuasions who want to join our mission. A very simple mission, remember Make America great again. And then after we make it great again, which we already have Weve had 141 days where the stock markets have reached their all-time historical high. 141, think about it. Out of three years, 141. And to me, I view it differently. Well, look at your 401ks. I mean, who is doing well with their 401k Up 90%. Up 104%. Is there anybody doing badly with the 401k Id like to not talk to that person. Does anybody have a 401k where theyre doing badly, please Oh, dont put up your hand. I dont believe it. Nah, the 401ks, theyre up 90%, 95%. I always tell this story. People come up to me. They say, I want to thank you. My wife thinks Im a total loser, sir. She thinks I am the worst person with money, with financial. She thinks Im just horrible. In the last three years, Im up 94%, sir. She thinks Im a total genius when it comes to finance. She loves me again. She didnt love me before, sir. She loves me again. That tells you something about money, doesnt it The first step to victory in November is tomorrow. Go send a message that Republicans And you can vote for the weakest candidate if you want. Dont worry about it. I dont really think we actually have a candidate against us that Republicans are energized, that were united, and that nine months from now we are going to take back the House of Representatives. We are going to hold the Senate and we are going to keep the White House. You know, they always talk about the Democrats. They have enthusiasm, right We have so much more enthusiasm than them. Its not even close. Theyre all fighting each other. Theyre all going after each other. You got them all over the place. They dont know what the hell theyre doing. They dont know what theyre doing. They cant even count their votes. Were thrilled to be joined tonight by many great leaders from across this state and this country, great national leaders. I want to thank our tremendous Vice President, Mike Pence, who spoke earlier this evening. And also with us, our warrior senators, the two people that wanted to be here. Theyre going to be here tomorrow. Theyre going to be here to get out the vote. I dont think we have to worry too much about it, but thats okay And very highly respected, Senators Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul. Great guys. Warriors, theyre warriors. Hey, Lindsay and Rand. Thats not bad. Can you imagine if you actually came from New Hampshire what it would be Right Thats not bad, but they have been great. All they do is they looked at everybody for the last couple of months and they said, Read the transcripts please. Read the transcripts. But I want to thank you both very much. Two great people, two great friends. Man, look at all that television back there. Whoa Thats bigger than those terrible Academy Awards, Ive got to tell you. That used to be big. Not so much anymore. A friend of mine, another great leader and somebody thats going to be Speaker of the House hopefully next year, Kevin McCarthy. Our leader, Kevin McCarthy. Oh, will that be nice to have Kevin, a pro. Youll see things get done like youll never believe. Thank you, Kevin, very much. Great. A very brave man He took a bullet. He got shot and he got up. He was going to die that night. I tell this story all the time. His wife, she was crying so much. When he finally did awake, I said, Well, one thing I learned, your wife loves you. Why do you say that Because she was devastated. I know many wives that dont get too upset. His wife was devastated. His family was devastated. The doctor told me he didnt have a good chance, but hes tough as hell and hes a really terrific friend.

I said, Get me the woman from Michigan to head up the RNC Whos that woman from Michigan to head up the RNC Thank you, Ronna. Great job. Setting all kinds of records, polling records, contribution records, everything. Were doing everything so its great. And Tommy Hicks. I want you to say hello, Tommy Hicks, whos a special friend. And Haley. Thank you, darling. I retweeted you, Haley. I retweeted you all over the place. And all together were building the worlds most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere in the world. Its a great thing. Its a great thing. Since my election, Americas gained 7 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has hit the lowest rate in half a century. The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country. You believe that one Thats pretty amazing. Thats pretty amazing. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached record lows, all time, never been lower than what it is now. And by the way, our poll numbers with African Americans, with Hispanic Americans, with Asian Americans, the other side is getting a little nervous because they are like rocket ships. Theyre going up. African American youth unemployment is so important. It was a horrible number a few years ago. You remember, it was a really terrible thing was happening. Its just reached the lowest time in the history, lowest, the best number in the history of our country. And African American poverty numbers have hit the lowest rate ever recorded. Wages for African American workers have increased by 2,400 per year, also a record. And you know this. For decades, the Democrat party has betrayed African Americans. They betrayed us all. They betrayed all of us. But were delivering for African Americans. Were delivering for Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans like nobody has ever done. We are fighting for great jobs, great schools, great healthcare, and a truly great future for our country and for them. We are the party of equal opportunity for all Americans. Thank you. To support working families, weve reduced the cost of childcare, expanded paid leave, and given 40 million American families an average of 2,200 more in their pockets thanks to the Republican child tax credit. Who would have thought that We have cut more job killing regulations than any You know this one. So you go back four years, eight years. In one case, longer than eight years. Weve cut more job killing regulations than any other administration in the history of our country, and were not finished. Weve ended the war on American energy. They want to take our energy away. They want to take our wealth away. They want to give us wind. Wind. If it blows, wonderful. If it doesnt blow, you got problems. Wind. They want to destroy our countrysides, put windmills all over them. Watch your house go down in value. You ever see what happens They build a windmill within distance of your house. You could forget about your house. You could just say, well, that was the end of that investment. You want to see a bird graveyard, go to the bottom of a windmill. Take a look. Its a graveyard for birds. They kill all the birds. Lowering utility bills and reducing prices at the pump, thats what were doing. We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies, Washington politicians You know this. They shuttered New Hampshire factories. You were one of the worst examples ever. NAFTA, what NAFTA to your communities, I mean to your state, is incredible. Shattered your communities and sacrifice your jobs on the altar of globalism. We can forget globalism. We want to take care of our country. New Hampshire alone lost one in four manufacturing jobs following that twin disaster of NAFTA and Chinas entrance into the WTO, the World Trade Organization, one of the truly bad deals ever made in the history of our country. For decades, politicians campaigned across this state promising to replace NAFTA. They lied. They never did it. They never even tried to do it. They wouldnt have been able to anyway. It wasnt easy, I will tell you that. But then they got elected and they did absolutely nothing. But Im not like those other politicians. I keep my promises. We took care of it. We took care of it. You saw last month being bye-bye. I say Donald J. Trump, bye-bye NAFTA. We ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new US Mexico Canada Agreement into law. Thats going to be great for our manufacturers, our farmers. Great for everybody. Great for our workers. The USMCA will bring jobs back to New Hampshire right where they belong. They should have never left in the first place. Probably the number one reason I ran for office. Im one for one. I have friends. Some of these great senators, look at Lindsey over there and look at Rand. These great senators. Sure, Ive run five times and Ive won three. And other senators said Sir, Ive won seven times, sir. Southern senator. I won seven times, sir, and Ive won five of those damn contests. I said, Senator, I ran once and I won just once. And were going to run twice and thats going to be it. Although they think were going to run much more than that, you know that, right It scares the hell out of the fake news, I will tell you. They cant take a joke. I also took the strongest ever action to confront Chinas massive theft of American jobs, and our strategy worked. Massive tariff and tariff money is pouring in and has poured in, poured in by the billions and billions. We never took in 25 cents from China. They ripped us so much you wouldnt believe it. Now they respect us again. Last month we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defeat so many of our opponents. The money thats pouring in, people dont even believe it. And by the way, the virus, theyre working hard. Looks like by April, in theory when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. I hope thats true, but were doing great in our country. China, I spoke with president Xi and theyre working very, very hard and I think its going to all work out fine. Rough stuff, I tell you. Rough, rough stuff, but I think its going to work out good. We only have 11 cases and theyre all getting better. But our trade agreement with China will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and substantially boost exports of American made goods. Is that nice After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. On no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than a thing called immigration, right Before I came into office, the far lefts policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country and thats what they want. I see them campaigning right down the street. Its really boring to watch, but I try and watch. No, I have an obligation to watch really boring stuff. But they want open borders. They want thousands and thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom are not exactly what were looking for, okay I mean murderers, rapists, and some other things. Theyre going to be poisoning our children with drugs, including right here in New Hampshire, and you have one of the drug problems in the country. And we brought it down 18% but we have to do better. 18%. Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. They want to let anyone into our country from all around the world. Just come on in, folks, were going to give you free healthcare. Were going to give you free education. Were going to give you more than our vets are getting. Every family will get a free Rolls Royce. You know I said that, Matt. I said that to them and some of the fake news picked it up and they said, President Trump said every family coming into our country illegally gets a brand new free Rolls Royce. He lied. He lied. He lied. They gave me a Pinocchio. They dont get it, Matt, do they, Matt Actually they get it better than we understand. They get it very well. They get it. They know whats happening. And the wall is being built. I will tell you the wall is being built. And you know they went after us on everybody knows the wall is going up. So whats happening You do know whos paying for the wall, dont you Right. Redemption from illegal aliens that are coming. The redemption money is paying for the wall. Theyre so sad to hear that because its okay, finally, they go. You have to understand an entire party is fighting. Theyll give me anything I want. Our military would rebuilt it. 2.2, its really 2.5 trillion over a period of three years. They give me anything but not 25 cents for the wall. They said, We like drones. Well, drones dont keep people out. Drones are wonderful. They fly around, take pictures. Were going to give you a drone. No good. So we now have built over 100 miles of wall. And when we have that wall built, you have to see what happens to the illegal aliens that dont come in. I say they cant come in. They dont come in. So we up to over a hundred, substantially more than a hundred miles of wall, and well have close to 500 miles of wall in the very near future. And by the way, you have to see. You wouldnt believe it. You have to see what happens when that wall goes up. You have to see the numbers change like magic. They change like magic. You ever hear the thing with all the modern technology, all of the new computers, the new genius, the new everything, cyber this, cyber that, two things never change, right A wheel and a wall. Right A wheel and a wall. Theyre going to have a lot of brilliant people working over the years. Theyre never going to replace the wheel and theyre never going to replace the wall, and its a high wall. Illegal immigrants coming in, coming into our country illegally, very few of them are getting in right now. Mexico has been terrific. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border and the numbers went down 87% from this year and this time last year. And for the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild the cities in America. We could rebuild our cities. But I have something, because people were screaming to me for the last four or five rallies, read the snake. The snake. Does anybody know what Im talking about She knows. Shes been standing outside for four days, no wonder. And you look good, Ill tell you what. Four days outside in the rain and snow. Look at these front row people. These are warriors. Theyre warriors too, like my congressmen and senators. I made minor changes. They mentioned illegal immigration. This is about immigration. This was a song from the 1950s, Al Green. And they mentioned little changes to it, thats okay. But they mentioned illegal immigration, right And I used to do this a lot and people couldnt get enough of it, to be honest with you. And I havent done it for a while, and I thought Id do it tonight because youre on the eve of giving us an opponent and all of these people want open borders. They want open borders, and we dont want open borders. We want very strong closed borders. And we want people to come into our country, but they want to come in through merit and we want them to come in legally, right Right Through merit and legally. Right So well do this quickly. This is illegal immigration. Its called Oh, listen to how quiet it is. Listen to how quiet. Now watch how quiet it gets. Gets so quiet. But this is all about I love you too. That was a guy that said that, but I love him too. I love everybody. Ready So important. Illegal immigration. On our way to work one morning down the path along the lake, a tender hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. Poor thing, she cried, Ill take you in and Ill take care of you. Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heavens sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk. She hurried home from work that night and as soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake shed taken in had been fully, fully revived. Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed that vicious snake. She clutched him to her bosom. Youre so beautiful, she cried. But if I hadnt brought you in by now, you truly would have died. She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed him and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, the snake gave her a vicious bite. Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heavens sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake. I saved you, cried the woman, and youve bitten me, but why You know your bite is poisonous and now Im going to die. Shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin. You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in. Got to come in legally and through merit. Under my administration were fully taking care of our own citizens first, including millions of African American and Hispanic Americans who are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities. In this region of the country alone last year, ICE officers We love our ICE officers. The Democrats dont like them. The Democrats dont like them. ICE officers are the toughest human beings, and they love the country as much as anybody in this room. Last year alone they  in this room. Last year alone, they arrested over 2,000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. Over 2,000 accused of murder, yet left wing politicians support sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into the American community. One of guests at the State of the Union was American citizen, Jody Jones. I introduced him that night. His beloved brother, Rocky, was murdered by a criminal alien in California, shot him eight times at close range, wouldnt stop. Rockys killer had been previously arrested many, many times, but under Californias totally insane and outrageous sanctuary law, authorities were ordered to set him free. Tragically, left wing politicians in New Hampshire tried to replicate Californias disastrous policies. Last year, the Democrat controlled New Hampshire house blocked legislation that would have banned sanctuary cities in your state. And by the way, you have a great governor, Chris Sununu. Hes on top of it. Hes on top of it. And his father is a great guy. His father didnt like me too much a few years ago. Once I won, Im telling you, he was so good. He was as good. He fought like hell for us, all of us. Its a great family, and Chris is doing a fantastic job. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote Republican in 2020, November. And thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down now at record numbers and weve ended catch and release. You know what catch and release is You catch an illegal alien by law. You then take his name and address. They dont have addresses. Whats your address What They dont have addresses. They come into the country, they dont have addresses. So you take his name and then you have to release him into the country and you say, Well see you in four years for your court case. We never see them. They never come back. We have seized record amounts of drugs. We have deported record numbers of gang members, MS-13 by the thousands. And we have done more to secure the border of our country than any administration in history.  Does anybody know who won Iowa I dont know. Maybe Rander, Lindsey. Grant, does anybody know who won Lindsey, youre a total pro. Nobody knows. He said nobody. Flip a coin. Flip a coin. Flip a coin. Theyre going to run your health care. Unbelievable. Nobody knows who won. Actually, I think theyre trying to take it away from Bernie again. I think Bernie came in second. Can you believe it Theyre doing it to you again, Bernie. Theyre doing it to you again. Were saving your healthcare while these socialist Democrats are trying to take away your healthcare. We are making healthcare better and much, much cheaper. Youve seen what we did. We are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will. The Republican party always will. Always will. And we got rid of the most unpopular thing in the healthcare world, the individual mandate. We had to pay a fortune not to have pay a fortune. You paid a fortune not to pay a fortune for bad healthcare. And we got rid of it, saved a lot of money for a lot of people. And were stopping surprise medical bills and making everything transparent. Thats bigger than healthcare transparency and thatll go unfortunately into effect right around the election time. It would be nice if we could get it earlier, but its all done. Its all signed. Because when providers are required to show you what the prices are, those prices are going to come tumbling down. Blood tests as an example, one hospital has them for 53. Another hospital, the same test, 2,415. Same exact test. And it may even be better, who knows Were approving more generic drugs than ever before at any time in the history of our country. Thats bringing prices down. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan. Remember President Obama, you could keep your plan. You could keep 28 times. You can keep your doctor. That didnt turn out very good. We should impeach him for that. Why arent we impeaching him 28 times, you can keep your doctor. We should impeach President Obama. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right Abraham Lincoln. Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community and every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm. We love people. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. People are signing up left and right. But if you want to vote for a weak candidate tomorrow, go ahead. Pick one. Pick the weakest one you think, I dont know who it is. We are a big party with big ideas for the future. Very big. We become a big party and an open-minded party and were the party that people like. Were the hot party and were the party with all the enthusiasm. We are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. Right We pass criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. Most incredible thing thats happened. Prisoners never really had a shot. Theyd get out, they couldnt get a job no matter what they did, and theyd go back. Theyd go back to their ways. I mean, in many cases I guess they had no choice. It was a disaster. Now theyre getting out and because our economy is so good and because of what weve done with criminal justice reform and other things like opportunities, zones, et cetera, theyre getting jobs and employers are loving them. Theyre doing great. Theyre doing great. They are doing great first time ever. Theyre not going back. To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 191 federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. And as you know, weve also confirmed two great new Supreme Court justices. Thank you very much. Thank you, Grant. Thank you, Lindsey. Thank you. We have invested 2.2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, as I said, and I love saying it because we are funding for New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Army National Guard readiness centers just a few miles from here in Pembroke and in Concord. Concord, I love Concord. I love Concord. Oh, Concord. You know how famous Concord is Concord. Thats the same Concord that we read about all the time, right Concord. I love Concord. I recognized Israels true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, been trying to do that for 52 years. We got it done. And for years you watched as your politicians  They really, I mean, they went out, Id like to apologize for the behavior of the United States. No, no. We dont know we dont apologize anymore. We dont apologize. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of New Hampshire. Thank you. At stake in our present battle is to survival actually of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory November 3rd, 2020. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. And I will tell you, that swamp is much worse than I thought when I was out here innocently campaigning. Lets drain the swamp. That swamp is a lot worse than anybody ever thought. That swamp is that dirty swamp. Thats a dirty swamp. You have some really evil, dirty, horrible people. Like to say nice, everyones nice. Theyre not good. Theyre not good people. But were draining that sucker slowly but surely. With your help, we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years. How about that Itll be done. We will land the first woman in the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant its flag on Mars. Were very advanced. All made in the USA. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to-  keep and bear arms. Were going to protect your Second Amendments. By the way, theyre going to take away everything. Theyre going to take away your wealth. Theyre going to take away your guns. Theyre going to take away everything. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God we trust. From Nashua to Dixville, from Portsmouth to Plymouth, from Concord to Claremont, and from Meredith to right here in Manchester, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. New Hampshire was founded by tough frontier men and strong, powerful pioneer women who defied the dangers and raised their children to embrace the eternal motto, Live free or die. I love that motto. Live free or die. These courageous Americans tamed the wilderness, braved the elements, changed the hills, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth and we are making it greater. Every single day, greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. Thats what this is all about. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of New Hampshire, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, New Hampshire. Thank you."
Winston-Salem,Sep8,2020,"Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Its a great honor to be in North Carolina. We had great, great luck and great people backing us in North Carolina. And Im thrilled to be in Winston Salem with thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots. You are great people. Great people. I dont know how many people here, but theres a lot. We said lets keep it down. They didnt do too good a job, but thats good. Thats good. Now these crowds, I tell you its beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm, beyond what we had four years ago in 2016, and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot. This is the most important election weve ever had. 56 days from now, were going to win North Carolina. Were going to win four more years in the White House. This is a choice. And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades. I dont think you has a bigger difference and maybe youve never had a bigger difference. This is the American dream and the other, I dont want to say it because Ill get myself in trouble with the fake news back there. But the other is a basic disaster for our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our childrens future to countries like China. Remember this, very simple to remember. If Biden wins, China wins. Its as simple as that. So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in and now weve opened it. And by the way, your state should be open. Your state should be open. Any governor that does that. And even if you look statistically, its you its Michigan, its a couple of others. Theyre closed. New York. Look what theyre doing in New York, what theyre doing to our beautiful New York. Its so sad. But you just take a look at whats going on in North Carolina. They want to open. They want to open. They want to open in Michigan so badly. They want to open. They want to have football. They want to have their schools open. And its a shame whats going on. And Ill tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open. Theyre doing it for political reasons. Theyre doing it for political reasons. They think by hurting the economy, by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings, offices, they think by keeping them and hurting them, youre hurting the economy. Our economy is doing phenomenally well. And its not only is it a V, its a super V. You see whats happened. We just had a jobs number come out, 1.4 million. Its down to 8.4%. Nobody thought that, 8.4. So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now were opening it up and your state should go with it. Were opening it up. And we will have a great third quarter. Its going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but were going to have a great third quarter. We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over. And this is that super V. But next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybodys taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you havent seen. And remember this, if Biden wins the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place. Theyre Biden people. Theyre Biden states and cities. Theyre Democrat states. If they win, the mobs win. You see these guys, they go around saying, yeah, I want your meal. Give me that food. Give me that. A woman sitting there, she wants to eat. And they come and they grab her food. They grab her drink. Nobodys ever seen stuff like this. This is all that ideology. Were not going to let it happen. Were not going to let it happen. And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time. We said, either do it or what going in. Were going to have to go in, do it. Let us go in. Were saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day. Let us go in. I said, let us go in. Well straighten it out in less than a half an hour. Now the US Marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody. You saw that. He killed a young man in the middle of the street violently. He had other charges against him. And I put out, when is he going to be arrested And they went in about 15 minutes later. And Ill tell you what our federal government is so ready to go. All they have to do is call us. Itll all be solved very quickly. They have to call them. But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places. They dont know what the hell theyre doing. If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win. He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesnt mean thats going to stop. He doesnt, he will never stop. If they win, its not going to happen, hopefully. Because this is not like a second place crowd. Lets face it. Are you seeing Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out Thats why he left. Finally, he left his basement. He said we got problems. I dont think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it. They understand it. He doesnt. So Im running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries. Because if we win, America wins. You know that. Youve seen that. Over the last three and a half years, weve secured Americas borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like youve never seen. They werent even broken. They were bad. They were bad from day one. Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%. In fact, I got it down to 98%. Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98. And they all said, no, no, its got to be a 100. I said, somebody else could finish. We want to get home. They said, no, youve got to finish it, so we took another two months, we finished it and were bringing them home. Were bringing them home. These great, great warriors. People dont like it when I say that. Secured American energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we are very simply, were doing it again and were on track to have, as I said, the best year weve ever had next year. You just had the best year. You just had the best year of the history of your state last year. Weve created a record breaking 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. But if sleepy Joe Biden takes power, the economy will collapse. He wont even know the difference. Hows the economy Not good, sir. Were in a depression. We are Whats that Joe Biden, who spent 47 years shipping North Carolina jobs to China and other countries, you know that. And Ive spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country. Weve never had so many jobs. Were up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere close. We got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that. Here in North Carolina, voting is already underway. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what theyre doing to burn down buildings or take control of government, set fire to a whole country. You know, when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago, I signed a very strong executive order. You want to knock them down Thats fine. But you go to jail for 10 years. It was amazing. It was amazing how that stopped. And then they said, well, well do it easily. Well do it through the process because they dont want to spend 10 years. You know, theyd look at it. Theyd say not worth it. 10 years is too much. But the DC committee, did you see about that They want to change the name of the Washington Monument. They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument. Now, were talking the big stuff. They finally hit the big time, took them awhile to get there. But I said that was going to happen. Dont worry about it. You dont have a thing to worry about. If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala. Remember Kamala She started at 15. She was supposed to win. Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four. Its like a free fall. You know what, people dont like her. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country. Biden wants to impose a 4 trillion tax hike, a ban on American energy, eliminate Americas borders, confiscate your guns. He wants to get rid of your second amendment. Were going to be appointing very pro crime judges, but they want to destroy your suburbs. You know, the rule, the regulation that I just terminated. They want to build low income projects in the suburbs. Theyve been doing it. Theyve been destroying suburbs. Were not doing it anymore. Somebody said suburban women, hows Trump doing But do you remember last time too They said women dont like Trump. I said, I think they do. I think they do. They said women dont, and then we did great with women. And remember that great. Was that one of the greatest evenings ever Four years ago. That was one of the greatest. But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better. Now were doing really well. African American vote, much better Hispanic vote, much better. He did better with African Americans than we thought. He did better with Hispanic than we thought. He did better with Asians than we thought. He did really well with women. Whats this all about Ladies and gentlemen. And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016. You remember that evening Was that the craziest That was the craziest thing. And they thought, I think they didnt think it, but Ill tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now. They dont understand. They do understand it. They do. Right They understand it. Look at that beautiful dress. And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much. Beautiful. Like it. But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again. Biden said the other day, well, if the experts told me. Were not shutting it down again. We dont have to. We learned about the disease. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. People dont realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting China. We put a ban on China, heavily infected. And Biden was against it. Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit. Its clear why both China and the flag burning rioters want Biden to win. They know his policies will be the downfall of America and they know my policies will lift America to new heights of national greatness like weve never seen before. Thats whats happening. Thats whats happening. And never forget, theyre coming after me because Im fighting for you. Theres a lot of truth in that one. And they do come after me. They do come after me. They have more things to say about me. Every day, its something. They said, you see the plane where it is Sir, would you like to take the car I say, why Im saying what Well, I heard you had a limp. I do I dont know about a limp. I dont have a limp. Hey, someday, Im going to have a limp. Ill let you know when. Youll see it. No, they make this stuff up. They make it up. They make stuff. Its called disinformation. They give a phony deal out. They did it two days ago with the military. Theres nobody that loves the military more than me. I was very lucky though. I had 15 incredible American Patriots that came by and they said, he never said that. They were there. They were there. But they make up stories, horrible stories, many, many. Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier. It was all made up. And frankly, if the shoe was on the other foot, if it was on the other foot, youd have many people, 20, 25 people right now in jail for two years and theyd be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and its treason or whatever else you want to call it. And its a disgrace that its taken this long. Its a disgrace that its taken this long. And let me just tell you a little secret. Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden. Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why dont you use the Logan Act on General Flynn Look at General Flynn, what hes going through for years. If that were ever reversed, Im telling you, youd have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago. Its a disgrace, but lets see what happens. Bidens a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities. And you know, he talks about like, well, hes going to do this. Hes going to  He doesnt have any idea. He has no clue. Hes going to do this. Hes been there for 47 years. And he just really left. He left three and a half, four years ago. So he just left, but hes been there for 47 years. Im going to do this. After 47 years, hes had a change of heart. This is the craziest election. This is the craziest  Look, somebody said, whats the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and slow Joe So the difference is the following. Shes meaner, probably not as nice. I dont know. You cant get any worse than her, when you think. But the big difference is shes smarter than he is. Okay. Hes a nicer person, but hes not smart. He never was, not in prime time and certainly not now. The Washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his partys nomination. Biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left, you know that, with crazy Bernie and everyone. And by the way, you know whos further left than crazy Bernie Kamala, Kamala, Kamala. You remember she left the race. Sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory, they should be able to win in California. I dont know. Maybe well make a play for that one too. But they picked somebody from California. I dont quite get it, but you always pick somebody thats hot. Thats going up in the polls, going up. Frankly, Im not sure. I dont think Ive ever said this, but probably Hillary should have picked Bernie Sanders to be her running mate. Right Because as crazy as it sounds, he was hot. He gave her a hell of a fight. A lot of people think he won and it got taken away. One thing about Bernie, hes the greatest loser Ive ever seen because look, any children here No not too many, but theyve heard it before. He got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again. Biden got the nomination. He got the nomination. But if Biden would have sat back and if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, you remember Pocahontas She finally faded. She faded badly. But if she would have dropped out on Super Tuesday, prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would have been the nominee. And I dont know who Id rather run against. One is super left. The other ones had to become super left. One is competent. The other one is only half competent now and heading south. Hes half competent and heading south rapidly. But the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because theyre united by their contempt for the American middle class in the truest sense. Thats why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over. If you look at that, its over the law abiding areas that we have. Republican cities and towns are doing great. Were doing great. And we dont have crime and we dont have this violence. Chicago over the weekend, many people killed, many people shot, shot. Theyre actually shot and killed. New York, the same thing. New Yorks gone through the roof. They were up 300% in certain categories. And you say, whats happening And we want to send them in so badly. Joe Biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a Democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters. And you know, we call you peaceful protesters, you know why Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if youre campaigning, you cant have more than five people. They- That if youre campaigning you cant have more than five people. They did that for me. If you are going to church you cant go to church anymore. You cant go to church. You cant go to church, you cant do anything. You have to stay in your house but if youre willing to riot, running down Main Street, if youre willing to riot and stand on top of each others face and do whatever the hell you want to do, youre allowed to do that because youre considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests even my people, my very brilliant consultants who I dont listen to too much, maybe I should. Sir, please dont say law and order. Thats too tough. Now in the meantime you look at these streets, people crazy. They say, Say law and order but with safety. I said, Look, people get it. Its just law and order, is that okay We want law and order. They say, Law and order and safety, sir. Could you add the word safety Because its  I said, I dont want to add. Its sort of obvious, right We want law, we want order. Biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that America is racist. By the way Ive gotten the support of almost every police group in the country. Sheriffs in Florida, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina. All over the country, but did you notice hes starting to talk a little bit tougher now, did you notice that He sees whats going on, his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees whats going on. Now hes starting to say, No, we need law and order. No he didnt say that, did he Hell never get to say that, cant say that because then itd lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party. You take a look at  You dont want to be dealing with the left. These people are stone cold crazy, you dont want to be dealing. Meanwhile Biden, he doesnt say a word about the thousands of African-Americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in Democrat-controlled cities. Theyre murdered by the thousands and they never, ever mention it. My heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities, not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down. Next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful Americans, remember this. These are Biden supporters, and if he wins, they will be in charge of your government as sure as youre sitting there. Youll be taking your monuments down. Youll be taking your statues down. Im not kidding, youll be taking them down. You have to look at the D.C. report, Im just telling you, go get it, you wouldnt even believe it. Its too crazy to even talk about, but were never going to give them a chance to do it. Were never giving them a chance. Were going to win, were going to win big. This is a very important state, and by the way  By the way, when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, when you get a ballot, say, Well I wanted to go and vote, darling. I wanted to go and vote. Why are they sending me those ballots Theres something really  The only way we lose North Carolina and a couple of others like Nevada, were doing great there. Now the governor decides were doing so well that theyre going to send out unsolicited. You have solicited and unsolicited. Theyre going to send out millions of ballots to you. People that never really thought in terms of it. Now sometimes youll ask for a ballot. Thats a solicited ballot. Its okay, you have to go through a process, you have to sign the form, you get it. Sending out millions of unsolicited ballots. Make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts. Make sure it counts. Because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things. Thats the only way as far as the eye can see, but theyll correct it. Theyll say, Hes wrong, it was 14,500, hes misrepresenting. Hes misrepresenting. Now I was told we have 15,000 and were in the middle of an airport someplace. Its a wonderful thing. I actually think  I dont know if you agree. So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas arent working out too well, right You cant really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, were rounding the turn on that but because of that  So we said where because we have the same crowds. I think we have bigger crowds potentially. We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport. Were doing all mostly hangar things because were outside. Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right But they say its very much different. So were doing these and were doing the outdoors, were doing the hangars, but I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago. Its pretty amazing. Its pretty amazing. We started off in New Hampshire, we said, Look, lets have 1,000 people, and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more. Were trying to be nice but then eventually we landed  Two weeks ago, we landed in New Hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and I mean its really amazing whats going on. All over the country, its amazing. Its amazing. Its a great thing. More support than we had four years ago because four years ago I said I was going to do this, I was going to cut your taxes, I was going to cut regulations, I was going to get right to try, I was going to take care of your vets, I was going to rebuild your military, I was going to do all these things and you said, I dont know. Thats a lot of  You know what Ive actually done more than I promised. Build a wall, build a wall, true. Ive done more. For instance you never heard me say, you never heard me say, a lot of you were at various rallies, you never heard me talking about space force. We built, think of it. A new branch of the United States military, the United States Armed Forces called Air Force. I never talked about that. Thats something we never talked about. I only figured that one out after I became president because I saw what Russia was doing and what China was doing. I said we have to do the same thing, and if you think that was easy, that was not easy. That was not easy, it was very hard. But what weve done  You know the wall now is past 300 miles. Its exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted. I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it. Sir, we have to be able to see through. I said, All right, lets go. Much more expensive. I said, Lets go. So were over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that weve ever had by far and its a good time to have it too. Thats right. Mexico is going to pay for it. What happens if they fight us Remember that answer Its going to get 10 feet higher. Remember that. What happens if they fight us on the wall The walls going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great. In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country. Can you imagine that 27,000, and I did that so that we dont put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple. I said you got to do it and the presidents been great, hes a friend of mine, hes doing a very good job. Not easy, Mexicos not easy, but hes doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and its a tremendous wall. Its everything that the Border Patrol wanted. I gave them everything. I said, What else do you want Its wired for every single thing you could have. Remember the Democrats, We dont want a wall, we want drones flying. Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right Biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail. Just last week Sleepy Joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police Portland District Attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals and violent extremists without charge. Now last night though, they arrested more than theyve ever done because we said you have to. We said you have to and we told them about  We will federalize them, well do whatever you need and I spoke to the governor, it looks like theyre finally, after 107 days, like theyre finally doing what theyre supposed to be doing but well let you know very soon. Otherwise were going in. The Biden-Bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide. Now you got to understand, Bernies a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and I got a lot of Bernie voters. I think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade. They understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off, theyre ripping us off on trade. I agree with him on that. The difference is I know how to do something about it, they dont. They dont have a clue. They just know theyre being ripped off, and a lot of Bernie people feel that. Thats a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing. We appreciate it, we hope we dont lose it. Because weve really implemented things. Weve taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and Chinas never given us 0.10. Its a one-way street with China. They havent given us  We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasnt dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently. Its a great deal. They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though theyre smart, very smart. Instead of saying hes not talking very nicely about us and were not going to order any more, were not going to do business, no. Instead they do the opposite. They give us the biggest orders  Our farmers are very happy. Our farmers are very happy. Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers 28 billion because thats what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U.S. Treasury but nobodys ever done this before. Nobodys ever done this before. With Biden its the reverse. His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with. Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, hell make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all. Never happened before. Bidens plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them. So on November 3 America faces a very simple choice. Do what you want, vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to, or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else. Wait till you see the numbers. Wait till you see the numbers. You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying. I said, Thats a big number, right I think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out, and theyre only lying if its us because they dont want to be bothered. In other words theyre not lying about Sleepy Joe, theyre lying about us, and I dont know if Im supposed to love that or hate it, I dont know if its an insult or not but I will take it. We dont give a damn. If thats the case, we have a virtual landslide going. We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it it would have been terrible, but you know what Fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word. We had the call perfectly and if I didnt have it, somehow with these people I guess Id still be here if you want to know the truth, but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing, the Republicans stuck together, and Kevin McCarthys done a fantastic job. He really has. With the exception of a half a vote from Mitt Romney, you can have him. Hes not too popular, I want to tell you, hes not a very popular guy in Utah. Hes not too popular. So it was 52.5 to a half. Hes a beauty, Ill tell you that guy. He couldnt get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now. Remember Utah, they said its too close to call, this was before the election, and they announced Utah, the polls are closed, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. Do you remember that like immediately I won by a lot and there was some guy running, McMuffin, McMuffin. McMuffin, he was supposed to be second. Even Hillary beat him. What a group. Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan Get out and vote for him. Get out and vote for him, okay Ill tell you hell be a great governor. He loves your state, hell be a great governor. Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope youre going to do well, Dan. I know youre really getting up there, its getting very close. Ill be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him. You know we had to take our convention away, he said youre allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, youre not supposed to have political rallies. I said, You know the money that your state is going to be losing But if this guy doesnt open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesnt open up your state, you have no choice, youre going to vote for him anyway but Dan, youll be so good. Dan Forest, go and vote. The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim ONeill. Jim Where is Jim Thank you Jim, thank you very much. Good luck. Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots. I dont like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff. I dont like it. I look at these crowds and if theyre going to cheat crowds are meaningless. Really, if theyre going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless. Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do. Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win. Were going to win Florida, I just left Florida, were going to win Florida. North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley North Carolina, great. Thank you Michael. Thank you, great job, and a very good friend of mine, a great guy, Mick Mulvaney. Wheres Mick Oh, I didnt know Mick was here. Look at him. What a good guy. Thank you Mick. We have a lot of big shots over there I see but what do you think about a guy named Mark Meadows, chief of staff We love Mark. Doing a great job. Hes doing a great job, Robert OBrien. Robert, how many hostages have you and I negotiated to get back, not giving anything but we have a record of what, Robert 50, 50 and 0. Were 50 and 0 on hostages. We got them back, we got hostages back from countries that youd never even heard of and its been pretty amazing. Robert, thank you very much and thank you all for being here. Mick its good to see you. Oh wait a minute, wait. Its a very, very outstanding senator. Oh Im lucky I got to see that. We love South Carolina, right Come here. Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham. Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones. Two great ones. They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey. Thats good and Tim is another one. So we have just incredible people in the party. Weve achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and thats driving them crazy. We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses. Remember, that was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost  53. No, but it was a terrible thing. Youd pass away and your kids would get the farm, theyd go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive. Theyd put big mortgages on the farm, theyd lose the farm, theyd lose the business. You dont have that anymore. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administrations job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster. For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back. Biden supported NAFTA, Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Think of it. But the big deal is, hes changed. Hes changed. After 47 years Ive changed. I swear to you Ive changed. Did you see him in the debates He was not too good, but thats okay. He was better against Bernie. Somethings going on there, I dont know. You know what Im talking about. But he was better against Bernie. But in the other debates, he was giving them everything they want. Free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally, colleges, everything. Now the new deal, under the new deal, they get lawyers. If they come in to our country illegally, we supply them with legal advice. You believe it lawyers This is what we need, is more lawyers. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and Chinas entrance into the World Trade Organization. Thats courtesy of Biden and his friends. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, its been incredible. Everyone said, Impossible. They all said it was impossible to get done, we got it done. And its a great deal. And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with Its such a disincentive to do that. Now that was the thing that was most important to me. I used to hate when Id see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and theyd make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing. It doesnt work that way anymore. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to Chinas pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs. Joe Bidens agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. In the face of Chinas economic aggression, we provided a historic 28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers. I will always stand with American agriculture. These are the greatest people, the finest people, and were not going to let others take advantage of them. For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, its just been this way for 20 years. Now, its going back up. I mean, it helped that I gave you 28 billion in all fairness, right If I didnt do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy. If I didnt do that, I think you wouldnt have any farmers right now. Really. It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers. 28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy. I said, Sonny, how much are they being targeted for He said, Sir, 12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16. So I said, 28, okay, thats fine. I said, We will give them 28 billion. They were unfairly targeted. And that was in order to get me, and by the way, China wants Joe Biden so badly. Oh, they want And you know who else would like them very badly Iran would like them very badly. Because I ended that Iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1.8 billion, in cash. And you know whats going to happen Theyre just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes. Their GDP went down 24%. Nobody ever heard of that before. Their country is in trouble. I dont want them to be in trouble, but theyre going to wait till after the election. When I win the election, theyre going to come to us and make a deal so fast. Watch how fast itll be. Theyre dying to make a deal, but they do want to wait. Lets wait two months, maybe well get lucky. Maybe were going to get lucky and Slow Joe gets in and were going to make a great deal. No, therell be in immediately after the election and theyll make a deal, well make a fair deal with them. But what Obama did and Biden did with that horrible Iran deal. I ended last administrations war on American energy. Biden has pledged to end production of American oil shale, clean coal, no fracking, wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters. We dont want to buy energy. Weve done that for a long time, for decades and decades. We dont want to do that anymore. I like being energy independent, dont you And Im sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car, oftentimes its below 2. You said, How the hell did this ever happen Thank you President Trump. Right Thank you President Trump And look at your electric bills, everything else. These guys, your electric would go up four, five, six times. The Green New Deal, its called the green new nightmare. While Im president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent. It should be for many, many years to come. Because the fact is, we dont have to be in the Middle East other than we want to protect Israel. Weve been very good to Israel. But other than that, we dont have to be in the Middle East. We dont need There was a time we needed desperately, we dont need that anymore. We have more than they do, isnt that nice After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally building our country. America first. Its America first. To bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunities zones. I worked with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great guy. He has passed criminal justice reform, prison reform, delivered permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that Obama never did, or couldnt do. And Biden. I call it Obiden. O Biden. Its too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden. And before the China virus, we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded. And were heading back to that level rapidly. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying African American voters. He betrayed them. Look at 1994, take a look at that. He betrayed them, what he did to them. He closed the factories in Baltimore and sent them to Beijing. They were all sent to Beijing. So many people went there. They went to all parts of the world, but a lot went to Beijing. He shattered the plants in Chicago and sent them to Shanghai. Unlike the previous administration, under my administration we put America first. And actually, if we werent interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere. And nobody has been through what Ive been through as president of the United States, nobody. They used to say Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. I said, Theres no way he got worse than me. But Lincoln was very, very badly treated by the fake news. Maybe in his case, it was real. I can tell you, in my case, its fake. Its totally fake. But nobodys been and should never be allowed to happen again. Lets see what happens. We caught them cold. Lets see what happens. But if we didnt have to That takes time, and energy, and all other things. 31. She could have said, Okay. She could have said, You got me. But she said, I got set up by the beauty parlor owner, who happens to be a Trump person by the way. I like the beauty parlor owner. She said, I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor. She set me up. I said, How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China No, its terrible, shes always preaching about the mask. You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor. When you go to bed at night, put the mask on. Ive spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when Im reelected the best is yet to come. Ill tell you that. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, weve achieved the most secure border in American history. Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot. Remember they said, Walls are old fashioned. They dont work. Really I always say, and Ive said it four or five times. Ill say it again if youd like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years. If youre lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isnt it But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop. Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right The wheel and the wall. Maybe Im wrong, who knows But I would say walls and wheels have a great future. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and weve deported 20,000 gang members, including the radical MS-13. We invested 2.5 trillion in the United States Military, all made in the USA by the way, We have the newest, finest military weve ever had, and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many, many decades. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability which everybody said could not happen, and veterans satisfaction with the VA has just reached 91%, the highest satisfaction level in history. I withdrew from the last administrations disastrous Iran nuclear deal as I said, and I kept my promise and recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the United States embassy in Jerusalem. And then I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace for many, many decades, decades. Even the New York Times said that was an amazing achievement. Do you believe that I said, Let me see that one. Now we did something that nobody thought was possible. Man, its Israel, as you see, and as youve read, Israel and UAE, highly respected leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected, and now we have other countries in the Middle East. They all want to come in. Its going to be a beautiful picture, going to be a beautiful picture. We killed the vicious founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. Why didnt Biden get himk They were after him for eight years, they never got him, I got him. The worlds number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American crews, Qasem Soleimani, we got him too. Soleimani. Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two worst terrorists in the world for many, many years, many decades. We kept America out of new wars and were bringing our troops back home. Were bringing them back home from all these far away places. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and what do we get out of it Biden voted for the Iraq war, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed the killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and for eight years he couldnt find or kill al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS. Couldnt find him, they looked, they couldnt find him. I found him and we hit him good. We hit him good. And you saw the Mueller family on television. You saw that at the convention, what al-Baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter, and incredible how our troops handled that. You should see it, it was incredible. Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world. How are we doing with China We just have the plague, weve had other plagues sent by them. I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election. This was going to be so easy. I probably would have not been here tonight. I would have said, No, we dont have to bother. This is going to be And now we have to work against a guy that doesnt know where he is, I cant believe it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Do you remember that I banned it. Everybody told me, No, no, no, you dont have to do that. But I said, We have to because Wuhan is very infected and theyre coming here, so I banned it. Later on it was said to be a great move. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. If Biden wins, China will own America, and it wont take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investmentHe didnt even have a job. Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Were delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers. The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world. People dont know that because the fake news doesnt want to write about it. Under Operation Warp Speed, were producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that were going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps. And this is something thats incredible. This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations. We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, rated the most liberal, are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric. Thats what theyre talking about. So now they know we have it. Its only a question of weeks or a small amount of time. So instead of saying, Thats a great thing. Were going to save lives, theyre trying to disparage it, theyre trying to make it politics. Theyre trying to do so. And now whats going to happen is well have it, and people wont want to take it. Thats really bad. Okay Thats really bad. But the Biden-Harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know were close to putting it out, getting it out, and were going to get it out fast. The vaccine will be safe. These are the greatest companies in the world to do this, the greatest labs, the greatest doctors, itll be effective and itll be delivered before the end of the year. And maybe as I said, much sooner than that. Joe Bidens plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and much more. And thats what youre in right now. Youre in a shutdown. Its crazy. Ive been to many states, theyre not in shutdowns and theyre doing better. Theyre doing better. Somebodys got to speak to this man, Dan. Maybe you got to talk to him, Dan. Go in a little early and say, You dont know what the hell youre doing You dont know what youre doing. Theyre hurting our people. North Carolina has to open up. By contrast, my administration is following the science, protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school, go back to school, go back to school. You ever see the statistics on young people I dont know. They have a great immune system. Lets get some of that immune system, but theyre amazing. I mean, thousands and thousands of people and theyre not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1%. Its an incredible thing. Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible. But young people are very strong against this horrible disease. Through our historic China virus relief programs, weve saved more than 1.3 million jobs for North Carolina workers. That worked out great. We provided 380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made 10 million in PPP loans to save-  And made 10 million in PPP loans to save your states tobacco growers. We saved your tobacco growers. We have them very much in our sites. We want to help them. The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger. Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations. We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%. You couldnt build a road. We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and well have it down to one. You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but youre going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months. Youre not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand. I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down. He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records. You wouldnt believe. I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is. He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country. Flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants, including many from jihadist regions of the world. Biden opposes school choice, he opposes North Carolina opportunity scholarships. And he has stated that if he is elected, charter schools are gone. He said, theyre gone. And theyve been incredible. In the second term Ill provide school choice to every parent in America. And well also take good care of our teachers. Our teachers are very, very important to me. Very important, nothing more important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just in finishing, I have to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. Well make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We are going to bring our companies back home where they should be. Ive been doing a lot of it, but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages, and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, surge, federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities. We will protect government benefits for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. What youre doing when you have all of these advantages, when youre giving them free healthcare, and free lawyers, and free college, and free everything, they all come. They didnt think of coming, but they see this, they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in. They want to come to America. Youre just bringing people in and we dont want to do that. We want people to come to our country, but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally, very simple. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless ridiculous foreign wars. Well build up our military like its never been built up before. We need our military for other reasons. We will have the strongest we have now. When I took over, our military was depleted. We have a lot of military people here. Our military was depleted, our planes were 50 years old. Now you have brand new, beautiful F35s, we have brand new rockets and missiles. And hopefully we never have to use them, I will say that. But the best way of not having to use them is to have them. If you have them We learned that in the school yards, right We learned that in the school yards, the best way is to have them. We have the strongest military weve ever had by far. Well end surprise medical billing require, price transparency, which Ive already signed into law, which by the way, kicks in on January 1st. You better elect me North Carolina. I did price transparency and Ive cut the price. Drugs are going to start going down at levels nobodys ever seen favored nations. So we did price transparency, kicks in January 1st. Could you imagine if this guys president and your prices start to go way down, hospitalization, doctors, you can choose your own doctor unlike with Obama, right Price is going way down, January 1st. I said, couldnt you start it sooner, but statutorily thats when it had it start. Could you imagine if this guys in and prices start dropping like a rock And theyll say, What a great president he is. He would have never done it. And your drug prices, prescription drug, Im instituting favorite nations laws. So were going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest. And yourr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world. Well protect medicare and social security, and we will protect your social security. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. Very exciting. And I will reopen NASA. That place was gone. They had grass growing out of the runways, you had to see it. Now its the number one space center in the world by far. You see whats going on. We will restore patriotic education to our schools. Oh, you know what Im talking about. Look at you. This is a very sophisticated group, Tom. You know what Im talking about, patriotic education. Well, the first thing they do is they want to take your history away. Thats a great group behind me. I dont know. Theyre activists. But you know what You know what it means, they want to take away your history. Thats why the monuments and the statutes, they want to knock them down. The first thing they do is take away your guts. Its guts. They take away your guts, they take away your statues, they take away your heroes. They take away your great generals. They take away your past. And I said, it was going to happen. I said, You know what They started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of. And I thought that was bad. And then they went up a little bit and now I said, Someday its going to be Robert Lee, someday its going to be Washington, someday its going to be Lincoln. Someday its going to be Jefferson, someday its going to be Benjamin Franklin. Its all of them. They take away your past. They never taken away our past. Thats the way they do it. You study it. Thats the way they go. They take away your guts. Well teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust. This is better than the arenas, I have to say, especially when you have a crowd like this. But theyre like this. They have such spirit in this country. People love our country so much. I went to Texas, I went to Ohio, I went to Florida, its always like this. They love our country and were not going to disappoint anybody. Were not disappointed. For years you had a president who apologized for America So you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of North Carolina. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I wouldnt say that lightly. And frankly, I thought the last one was, and I said it, but theyve gone to a level that nobody even thought possible. These people have gotten stone cold, crazy. And you know what After we get in, were going to have tremendous success. And it was building. We were at a point, we were so successful before the plague came in from China. We were so successful that we were starting to get together. People forget. We were starting Success brings people together. It was so good. Our jobs numbers were so good. And whether it was the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, our jobs were so good, our numbers were so good. We were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop. We had to close it up. We had to open it and start all over again. If you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market, some of the stock markets have already broken every record. You look at NASDAQ, you look at some Were far ahead of what I had planned. Were far ahead of schedule. But we did it once, we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event, a terrible event, a horrible event. So many people died. Nobody should have died, not one person. So many people died, but if we didnt do it right, we would have lost millions of people. Just a terrible thing. But oftentimes I say, bring people together. And then I realized, if you look at that last few months, we were starting to come together. I was getting calls from, you wont believe it, Democrats. I was getting calls from Democrats and they were saying, Wow, things are going really well. It was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because itll happen again. Therell be great unity, eventually therell be great unity. So get your friends, and get your family, get your neighbors, and your coworkers and vote. And I say this because its from Charlotte to Kitty Hawk, from Durham to Asheville, and from Wilmington to right here in Winston-Salem. We inherit the legacy of North Carolina Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, one, two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you North Carolina. Thank you. "
Charlotte,Mar2,2020,"I want to thank you very much. North Carolina, thank you very much. Im thrilled to back in the great city of Charlotte, where, by the way, were having our convention. I guess you heard that, right With thousands of hardworking American patriots who love our country, cherish our values, respect our laws and always put America first. Eight months from now, were going to defeat the radical socialists. Were going to win the great state of North Carolina in a landslide. We won it last time, were going to win it this time by even more. And you know, Eric and Lara named their daughter, you know what her name is Carolina, Carolina. Her name is Carolina for a reason. This is an incredible time for our nation. Our country is stronger than ever before. And today, we just had the largest one day increase in the stock market in history. Thats great. Thats great. That was great. You know, our opponents were saying,  Oh, maybe hes in trouble, maybe the economy   Theyll do anything. Theyll do anything. Im sure they were thrilled. Do you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today I dont think so. By the way, look at this. Look back there, look at all of that press. Look at all them. Man, I dont know if Sleepy Joe, or Bernie, I dont think they have that much press. Bernie was going wild. Why would I be here tonight Why would I be here He said why would I be here tonight We dont have the primary, weve already won the thing, you know I was going to say the you know what thing, I held it back, because theyll say, Horrible language. He used horrible language today. But were doing fantastically. Theres never been a time where the Republican Party was so unified as it is now. Never, never. And you hear about enthusiasm for crazy Bernie, and thats true, he does have some enthusiasm, but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people, too. And theres not a lot of enthusiasm for Biden. I thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said hes running for the Senate. I looked at the First Lady, I said,  Hey, hes running for the Senate. And today he just said Super Thursday, hes looking forward to Super Thursday. Jobs are booming in our country, incomes are soaring, poverty has plummeted, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the United States military. Every day, for me and for you, its promises made, promises kept. One of the most important promises I made is right to this era. You know, we look at it, its the never ending wars in the Middle East. Were taking our soldiers, were bringing them back home. Were not law enforcement. Were bringing them back home. American troops cannot be the policemen for the world, or to create democracy in other nations that frankly probably dont want it. The job of the American military is to secure and defend our country. Two days ago, the Unites States signed a deal with the Taliban so that after 19 years of conflict, and very close to 20, we can finally begin to bring our amazing troops back home. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own American citizens And all of the things that weve done, weve wiped out the terrorists, weve done so much, and you know what Were 8,000 miles away. You got a lot of big countries surrounding Afghanistan, youve got Afghanistan itself. The progress that was made, was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform. You know that. We pay a special tribute, and I know you pay it, a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice. As we bring back our troops, we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to America in the first place. Theyre not coming here, and if they do, bad things happen to them. We must keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. By the way, I have to say this, you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside. Somebody was saying that if Pocahontas, any one of them, Sleepy Joe, he doesnt have that, so he doesnt have a lot, he has very small crowds, but if Sleepy Joe or if any of them had a crowd one-tenth this size, they go around talking about how big the crowd. They never say that. Hey, take your cameras and spin them around this big arena. Right now. Spin them around. No fun to be a protestor at a Trump rally, but do we have a great time at a Trump rally My administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect Americans from the Coronavirus. You know about this whole thing Horrible. Including, sweeping travel restrictions. Today, we met with the big great pharmaceutical companies, and theyre really working hard, and theyre working smart, and we had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies. Theyre going to have vaccines I think relatively soon. And theyre going to have something that makes you better, and thats going to actually take place we think even sooner. So a lot of good things are happening, but we have strong borders, and really, our tough and early actions have really been proven to be 100% right. We went out, were doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country. Were working on that very hard. We closed our borders very early. I took a lot of heat for that. Remember when I closed the borders to certain areas of the world I took a lot of heat. But there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection, think of it, keep all of the infection, let it come in. And were working with other countries. In all fairness, look, its a problem, were working with other countries. Remember this, over the last long period of time, the flu, the common flu, you know this, right From 27,000 to 70,000 people get infected, and many people die. Think of it, 27,000. You lose 27,000 people to the common flu. It can be much more. One year was much higher than the 70,000 number. Those people died. So when you lose 27,000 people a year, nobody knew that. I didnt know that. Three, four weeks ago, I was sitting there, I said, What do we lose with the regular flu They said, About 27,000 minimum, goes up to 70, sometimes even 80, one year it went up to 100,000 people. I said, Nobody told me that. Nobody knows that. Last year was approximately 36,000 people died. So were working hard on it, and were going to come up with some really great solutions. In the meantime, were stopping  Only in North Carolina. Only in North Carolina. It can only be. How many people here are from South Carolina, by the way All right, we love both places. But that was from North Carolina. But just to finish up, so weve made a lot of progress, weve really done a great job with it. Were keeping our borders strong. My job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first, and thats what Ill do. Washington Democrats are trying to politicize the coronavirus, denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals. But honestly, not so much anymore. Everyone appreciates, these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do. Were actually helping a lot of other countries where they have some very, very big problems. So we have our professionals in constant touch, Im in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out. But the political attacks from some of the Democrats really must stop. Weve got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people. Were going to safeguard our people, the United States. The United States is, right now, ranked by far number one in the world for preparedness. Earlier today, when I met with the pharmaceutical companies, things were discussed and learned honestly. The media didnt know. Nobody knew. Theyve never heard this before. And we learned a lot, and maybe that had the impact on the stock market. Who knows what happened, but were going to reduce and the severity of whats happening, the duration of the virus. We discussed all of these things. We will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible. And I have to say, with a thriving economy the way it is, and the most advanced health system on earth, America is so resilient, we know what were doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth. We have the greatest health system on earth. The renewal of American strength over the last three years means at times of challenge, we are the best prepared to rise to any occasion. No country is better equipped than America to handle new threats, and no people are more skilled, talented, tough, or driven than Americans. And together, we are in the midst of the great American comeback. Thats what it is. Last month, we added 225,000 new jobs in January alone. That makes seven million jobs since the election. We have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He is dead. And we took out the worlds top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign on terror forever, Soleimani. While the extreme left has been wasting time with vile hoaxes and delusional witch hunts, we have been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, and lifting up American citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. Tomorrow, voters in states across the nation will head to the polls for Super Tuesday, not Super Thursday. No, he said, Super Thursday. You cant do these things. Can you imagine if I said Super Thursday It would be over, right I would be over. No matter how good you are at certain things, you cant, as an example, a name like Sleepy Joe, hes constantly naming the wrong state. Its great to be in the state of Ohio. No, no, no, Im sorry, youre in North Carolina. No, no. Joe Do you ever see them run up with a sign, No, no, North Carolina, Joe Once that happens, you might as well leave the states, because its a disaster no matter how good youre doing. Were in North Carolina Its great to be in Idaho No, youre in Iowa. Nah, he makes a lot of those mistakes, theyre a little scary Were going to protect your second amendment, you understand that. But did you see, Sleepy Joe, did you see Sleepy Joe, where he said, Last year, 150 million people were killed by guns in our country. 150 million That means 50% of our country. Thats a big story. 150. Can you imagine Trump saying that These people would never let me live it down. We cant make even a little mistake. We cant make even a little, tiny, tiny mistake. If we make a tiny mistake, its headlining. They say things like 150 million people killed, guns, they say Super Thursday, they say Georgia, hes looking forward to winning Georgia tomorrow. Georgias not in Super Tuesday So many mistakes You cant do that when youre negotiating with China. Cant do that when youre negotiating with these countries, can you Those mistakes would be very tremendous. Then you have Mini Mike. You see this guy Can you believe it Mini Mike. Hes being interviewed tonight on Fox. Can you believe it Fox. They want to be politically correct. They want to interview, they end up interviewing more Democrats than Republic  I dont know whats going on with Fox. But theyre interviewing this guy the night before  Mini Mike, ay, ay, ay, what a mess he is. The worst debate performance in the history of presidential debate history. The worst in history. Nah, I got to have more. Id get down real low, but I dont want to copy him. Everybody saw it. Everyone said, Oh, they all say, Oh Do that again where you get down low. But if I do that again, its a copy. Its a copy No, no. No. You never like to copy, even though youre copying yourself. You dont like to copy. You do it once. It was a big hit. But you do it once, and you sort of say, That was nice, dont do it again, because if it doesnt work the second time, it gets embarrassing, right Right We all know. But no, hes a disaster waiting to happen. Hes a mess. No matter which Democrat candidate youre talking about, and you understand that, any one of these candidates  And you see whats happening, right Its being rigged against  Its sad. Its being rigged against Crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie is going to go crazy. Crazy. I think Crazy Bernie is going to be more crazy when they see what theyre doing. I called it a long time ago. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Buttigieg, May Pete, he quit. Out last night. Then I hear a Senator from a state were going to win, were going to win that state, but she dropped out. Sounds like they made a deal. They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why They made a deal. You know why Quid pro quo, thats why. Dont care. Quid pro quo. Quid pro quo, they made a deal. Impeach them They should be impeached They should be impeached Quid pro quo. But theyve embraced an extreme left wing agenda. Their plans would massively raise your taxes, destroy our liberty, muzzle our faith, and erase our sovereignty. You know that. The Democrat Party has gone crazy. Whether its Bernie Sanders plan to eliminate private healthcare, Elizabeth Pocahontass plan  By the way, shes history. Shes history. I came up with that name far too early, I shouldve just waited. But it didnt matter. I thought she was making a come back. I said, Wow, I just did it to her. But you know those embers were burning a little bit a couple of months ago They never caught on. In fact, shell probably lose the State of Massachusetts to Bernie. So she doesnt know what to do because youre not supposed to lose the State of Massachusetts if you get in there. Shes the Senator. Shes the Senator for Massachusetts, I think shes going to lose it to Bernie. And Miss Michigan, you see whats going on over there Michigan, were leading. Were leading in Wisconsin. Were leading in Florida. Were leading in the last election. Hey, how great was the 2016 election One of the greatest nights, one of the most highest rated television nights in the history of television. And remember, there was oh, this is going to be a quick one. This is going to be oh, that wasnt so easy for them. I love the scene. The scene of that convention center where Hillary was getting ready to speak, and then she found out she lost. But Elizabeth Warrens here to plan to eliminate our borders, or Mini Mikes plan to eliminate your second amendment. Mike Bloomberg wants to eliminate your second amendment. Dont worry about it, its not going to happen. Not going to happen for him. For sleepy Joe, he doesnt even know where he is, what hes doing, or what office hes running for. Actually, I honestly dont think he knows what office hes running for. And it doesnt matter. Maybe he gets in, because hes a little more moderate. So maybe he gets in. But hes not going to be running it. Other people are going to. Theyre going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country. But theyre going to be super left radical crazies. Theyre going to be super left radical crazies, Joes going to be in a home. Hell be watching television. Everything will be just fine. The insanity of Washington Democrats is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great Republican party. We have the enthusiasm in our party. No, I really mean it. I constantly hear about the enthusiasm. Theyre fighting each other, they hate each other, they dont know whats going on. We have all the love, we have all the enthusiasm, and we know what were doing. We know what were doing. So were thrilled to be joined tonight by many really great, terrific, brilliant, wonderful warriors. Even though he comes from a slightly different state, but not to far by, is somebody that really has distinguished himself, hes become a great friend of mine. What he did for Justice Kavanaugh, do you remember that One of the greatest statements ever made in the United States Senate, Senator Lindsey Graham. Come on up, Lindsey. Lindsey Graham, come on up, Lindsey. Come here, Lindsey. I got to have him say something, come here, Lindsey, great guy. They handle pressure so well. They came and we gave a rally that was like this and Dan Bishop and Gregg Murphy won by so much, it wasnt even close. Theyre great people, and theyve done a fantastic job. Thank you very much. They handle pressure. They were under a lot of pressure, they handled it well. Its nice to know people can handle pressure, there arent too many of them. North Carolina Republican party chairman Michael Whatley. Thank you, Michael. I have a few great friends of mine and they love North Carolina. Louis DeJoy, who you know, Louis DeJoy. Two great people, diamond and silk. Right Diamond and silk. We love them. You know the first lady, a long time ago now, right How long is that Probably almost almost five years ago, she said, There are these two women on the internet, theyre unbelievable. Theyre unbelievable. I said, Oh, I know, I hear that all the time. I hear it all the time. She said, the next day she came again. She said, I saw them again, theyre unbelievable. I said, Let me see. I saw them, I fell in love with it, and everybody fell in love with Diamond and Silk. So thank you. Some people that have really been helpful to me, Corey Lewandowski, David Bussey, and Pam Bondi, right here. Thanks also to all of the people who are working to make the 2020 Republican National Convention right here in Charlotte an outstanding success, RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel, RNC co chairman Tommy Hicks, and Convention president Marcia Lee Kelly, thank you all. Youre doing a great job, Ill tell you theyre looking, theyre going to spend a lot of money and doing a good job. Should we doing a great job, but just an okay job It doesnt matter as long as you win. You know what I gave when we won last time, somebody else took them to convention center, spent a fortune and I just took a hotel ballroom. I said, What the heck, if I win, nobody cares, if I dont. Look if you win, nobody cares what room youre in. If you lose, nobody cares what room youre in. So we took a ballroom, nice ballroom, thats it, no big deal. I think it this way, if we win, nobody cares. And if we lose, Im out of there, I save a hell of a lot of money. Every place that weve gone, its been amazing. Id also like to recognize, so important, a woman whos really helped us win North Carolina in 2016, I have a feeling this year, shell even do better, because she happened to grow up here, Lara Trump and my son Eric Trump. Two great people. I mean I have to say that about my son, but I know a lot of people dont like their sons that much, but Lara has been fantastic, and thank you very much, what a job. She knows this state better than anybody in this room except maybe this guy right here. How are we doing, Lara How are we doing How are we doing in the state, are we doing good And were doing well in Pennsylvania I hear, and South Carolina, I know were doing great there. Also with us tonight, is a man whos really become a good friend of mine. We were going at it a little bit at the beginning, but I will tell you, and I would say if I didnt get along, I would not be here. I wouldnt do this. I think hes been tremendous. Hes been a tremendous supporter and things that weve wanted to do, and fights that weve had which were so important, hes been right up, and Lizzie will tell you that hes been right up in front and really he deserves another six year term. Probably a lot longer than that, but hes going to come up and Im going to ask Senator Thom Tillis, come on up. Thom has really been incredible, hes been working everyday. And he really wants to fight to the radical left and he does it and he knows how to fight, and take care of our amazing veterans, and stop illegal immigration. Thom is the champion for the people of North Carolina. This November, we need everybody to go and vote for Thom, hes doing great. Hes doing great. I hear hes way up in the polls, hes way up in the polls. Thom, say a few words. Get me off this stage. Get me off. You guys didnt tell me this was going to happen. No, that was great Thom. Were also honored to be joined tonight by a true American hero, a veteran of World War II and the Korean War who just turned 100 years old. His name is George Washington Perry, legit. George, thank you very much for being here. Thank you, George. 100 years. Hes 100 and he looks good. Thank you, George. With the help of everyone here tonight, America has now become the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth. Since my election over 219,000 new jobs have been created right here in North Carolina. We have lifted 10,000,000 people off of welfare, including 7,000,000 people off of food stamps. Median household income has reached the highest level ever recorded, think of that. The average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history, thats happening, thats happening. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest level in recorded history. Very important to me, African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low. African American poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded. For decades democratic politicians betrayed, and they truly did, they betrayed African Americans. My administration is delivering for African Americans like never before. No president has done more for our black community, no president has done more for our black community, and its an honor to do it. Last month here in Charlotte, we launched a nationwide campaign to create a better future for all Americans. Its called Opportunity Now, you know about it. Were also fighting to ensure that working families have access to paid family leave, reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40,000,000 american families an average of 2,200 thanks to the Republican child tax credit. The Republicans are claiming that we did that nobody else did, but the Democrats are saying, How did they do that one. The USMCA is a giant for North Carolinas incredible farmers and factory workers. And by the way, speaking of farms, factory workers, and small businesses, are all for the death tax. You know about the death tax, right Its called the inheritance tax. You have a small farm some place, you have a small business, you have a nice business, you no longer have an inheritance tax or a death tax. So if you want to leave it to your children, you can leave it to your children, theres no tax to be paid by your children. So they dont have to go back to the evil banker, borrow money from the banker, lose the farm, lose the business, it wont happen. And I always say, I know a lot of parents that dont love the children very much. Is there anybody in this room that does not love your children Please raise your hand. Please raise your hand. Nobody. Nobody, thats because were North Carolina, you love your children. But if you dont, then it doesnt matter because if you dont love your children, dont leave them a damn thing, but you dont have the inheritance tax anymore, which is great. A lot of people dont even know that, but thats a big deal or no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betraying the American people than on the issue of immigration sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminals to terrorize your communities. Right here in North Carolina, believe it or not, the sanctuary county of Durham released an illegal alien criminal, who then receded to viciously murdered a young 19 year old woman last year, you know all about it. Killing her and dumping her body into the woods. Last year alone, sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina, how did that happen to North Carolina Deliberately set free hundreds and hundreds of, and these are really dangerous criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of burglary, gun crime, sexual assault, kidnapping, and even suffering they inflict on our people. Were building the wall. Were building the wall. Were building the wall. Were building the wall. Mexicos paying for the wall, by the way. We built 127 miles as of today, 127. Mexico is paying for the wall. The media is going to be thrilled when I explain that Mexico is paying for the wall because you know, now finally they said Ive had obstruction like you wouldnt believe. The entire democratic party. I could get anything. I created Space Force. I could do anything. I could get. Lindsey and Thom Tillis knows. Mark knows this. All of them knows this. If I wanted 25 cents for the wall, they didnt want to get it. They didnt want to do it, but now we got it, and you think thats easy Nobody else could have done this. Were building it. Were building our hearts away. Well soon be building many, many miles a week, but were up to over 125, I guess 127, 28 by now, of the super duper wall, super duper. I went to Border Patrol, I said,  What is your wish Well, sir, wed like it to be steel and concrete. They want it exactly what they have it, and the barriers up top, they want everything. Its called a no climb provisor, no climb provisor. I said, What does the word provisor mean They didnt know. All it means is youre not able to climb over it. It is very tough. I dont know if you saw. In a part of the wall, a couple of weeks ago, they were climbing the wall, and the fire department had to come and take them down. Thats what the no climb is. Thats what the no climb is. Its a no climb. Its more money. Its a little more expensive. Thank you. Who is that What a voice. Pavarotti. So, were building the wall. Its going great. So, they said, All right. Hes building the wall, but Mexicos not paying for it. Yes, they are. Youll see. Youll see. You understand. Some of you understand because I told a few people last week, it got linked to the fake news media. If you want to end sanctuary cities in North Carolina and across America, then you have only one choice. You must vote Republican. You have to. You have to. Weve added catch and release, one of the worst loopholes youve ever seen, catch and release. You catch them. You then say, Where do you live They dont know because look, lets face it, they dont know. I understand that. Its not even to be laughed at. They dont know. Where do you live I dont know. Mexico, maybe, Honduras, Guatemala, who knows El Salvador. Where do you live Like this guy, hes a Mexican. Youre about as Mexican as I am. Look at this guy. Hes as Mexican as I am. Look at that hat. Are you Mexican Are you Mexican No, youre not. Are you He is. Its like Elizabeth Warren. She said she was an Indian. I said, I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none. She said, Oh, this is terrible. So she went out and got a test and it turned out not so good for her. Right 1024th, right One thousandths, so I was right. I probably have more in me. What a phony she is. What a phony. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme. 132 Congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders healthcare takeover. While the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and your social security, and they are going to destroy your social security. Remember they used to say with me, Im going to end it the first day. Well, you know what, were going to soon be four years and all Ive done is make it stronger. You know that. My administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. Youre going to have great health. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember President Obama You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan. 28 times. They said, Impeach him. You should impeach him. 28 times he lied. 28 times on record, You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. Well, thats not true. It wasnt. Impeach him. Were making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office. We are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and theyre better plans. We are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will, and we are trying terminate, in the Supreme Court of the United States, the worst healthcare in the world, and we are going to give you the best healthcare youve ever seen at a low price and again, protecting preexisting conditions. Protecting preexisting conditions. Were fighting to stop surprise medical billing. You know what that is Surprise. You get all sorts of surprises. We have people that take a blood test in one place, its 26, and in another place its 2000. Same blood test, maybe the cheap one is better, who knows Same blood test. Its wrong. Surprise medical building. Bombed. Out. Billing. I signed an executive order opposing price transparency thats going to be bigger than healthcare, because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. Right Its a big thing. Its a big thing. Weve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as name brand drugs, but a fraction of the cost. We have given them, and theres a lot of political pressure not to do that, you can understand why. To care for our amazing veterans, we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, and nobody said it could be done. So now, instead of waiting in line for days and days, and weeks and weeks to see a doctor, you go outside, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get all fixed up. What a great thing. Its called VA Choice. I got it done. Theyve been trying to pass it for almost 50 years and they havent been able to. Those people over there were a great help. We have passed the spectacular Right to Try. You know what that is Hopefully nobody in the room needs. Hopefully nobody in the room needs Right to Try. We are combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. Weve launched new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimers, and were pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for Americas youngest patients, and breaking all records in so doing. Virtually every Democratic candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb, right up until the very moment of birth. How about that That is why Ive asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God. Then you have the Governor of Virginia. The baby is born. The baby is born and he says, And then you go over and start talking to the mother as to whether or not you execute the baby. This is the Governor of Virginia. The Governor of Virginia. Hes a beauty. You remember what he did He wanted to dance like Michael Jackson and his wife stopped him. He got lucky. But the Governor of Virginia wanted to do that. The baby is born and then he goes over and talks to the mother. The doctor will now talk, and youll make a decision as to whether or not the baby lives. Did you ever hear of anything like this The Democratic party is the party of high taxes, high crime, unlimited regulations, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. So many people came up to me tonight and they want me to fight, and were doing it for school choice, so that every child who needs it, gets it. No parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. Alice Johnson, do we love Alice Johnson This could not have been done by anyone other than the Republican party. I recognized Israels true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our historic investments in the United States military include 200 million to a place that nobodys heard of in this audience, Im sure, Fort Bragg. 300 million for Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. More than 500 million for Marine Corps Air Station New River. Listen to this one. No Democrats going to this. They dont even want to spend money on the military. They dont like the military. Theyre not going to spend money. 1.2 billion for Camp Lejeune. 1.2 billion. Do you think that a guy like sleepy Joes going to put, he doesnt know what it means. I know what I means. We have to have a strong military. We have the strongest military weve ever had. When I came in, our military was in sad shape. It was depleted, but weve rebuilt it, 2.5 trillion dollars went into our military. 01 is the actual survival of an our nation itself. If you want your children to inherit the blessings of generations of Americans who fought and died to secure, and you know what theyre securing, they are securing us, theyre securing our freedom, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November, November 3rd to be exact. Only this way can we save the America we love, and drain the Washington swamp, which is by the way, much more vicious, much dirtier, much deeper than I ever thought, but we are kicking ass. With your help, we will lift billions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration, and we will continue with the great Thom Tillis. We will get Thom Tillis. Thom, I dont think anybody even wants to run against you, Thom, but were going to reelect Thom Tillis. Is that right Were going to reelect Thom Tillis. If we dont, Im going to be so angry at you. Ill only come back here a few times a year. No, Thom is going to be great. Thom, I think youre in great shape. I think youre in great shape. One more hand for Thom Tillis, please. We dont even know whos running against him. Nobody wants the run. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful, beautiful, beautiful phrase Made in the USA, right Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in less than nine years. Weve already started. Who would have thought We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. Your second amendment rights are under siege. Believe me, theyre under siege. We dont get in, you can forget your second amendment. Thats what I think. I really believe it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that binds us together as one beautiful America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work, and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust. From Fayetteville to Wilmington, from Raleigh to Greensboro, from Asheville to Kitty Hawk, to right here in Charlotte, this state is the home to some of the toughest men and strongest women, and most incredible patriots ever to walk the face of the Earth. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, blazed the trail, sailed the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, won two world wars, defeated fascism, and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, thats whats happening. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of North Carolina, the best is yet to come. Because together, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we have made America great again. Thank you. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you."
Tulsa,Jun20,2020,"Thank you, thank you. So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. Ive been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Dont go, dont come, dont do anything. Today it was like, Ive never seen anything like it. Ive never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that were doing very well in Oklahoma, thats the word. Thats the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, were going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh Were going to stop the radical left. Were going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what weve done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, thats an all time record. Thats an all time record. Ive always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, were going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, theyre great. They are, theyre great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. Weve spent over 2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether its submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, its all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Wheres my Senator Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, hes running, hes great. But well get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if youre a veteran, for years and years, theyve wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if youre a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. Its never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, thats how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didnt love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldnt get rid of them because they were, lets say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, lets say, lets just say. And so you couldnt get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who Im going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say We say, youre fired, get out, right Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But its happening. Its happening, I never knew it was so deep. Its deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. Were lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. Ive been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess Im old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldnt lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that How do you figure that And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong Hes in Iowa and he says its good to be in Idaho. No, no, youre in Iowa. Hes in New Hampshire and he says its great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, youre in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasnt happened to me yet. When that happens, theres nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. Thats called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. Thats OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost 40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost 40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think youre going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like childs play to the people in energy. She has one problem, its called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And hes standing in front of a building saying, things are very peaceful here. And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire Ive ever seen. The whole town is burning. Its like the biggest fire. And he said, Things are very good here, Anderson. I think its great. These are wonderful people, Anderson. Did you ever see that It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, You got to get  you cant protect yourselves. I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle Isnt that great So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, were not talking about some little place, were talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle They took over a big chunk and the governor, whos radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And Id have an offer out, I said, Anytime you want well come in, well straighten it out in one hour or less. Now I may be wrong, but its probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who were going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, Congressmen, what do you think I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country. But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they dont complain. Theyre incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They dont talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, theyre not wearing their mask. You dont hear their say, as theyre breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing. But you dont hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we  I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We dont ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, dont do it, dont do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like were terrible. And what weve done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. Weve tested now 25 million people. Its probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germanys done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job youre doing  Heres the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, youre going to find more people, youre going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people dont know whats going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young mans 10-years-old. Hes got the sniffles. Hell recover in about 15 minutes. Thats a case, add him to it. Thats okay. Thats a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though hes very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right We know him Now listen, he said to me, something thats amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system How about a piece of your immune system They dont even know about this. Lets open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. Were not conforming, thats why were here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 oclock in the morning and a very tough, Ive used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, Im sorry, this numbers no longer working. By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether its a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and youre sleeping. So what are you going to do, right So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the councils already passed it. In Seattle, you see whats going on there, its even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. Theyre crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. Were a great country. You are so lucky Im president, thats all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, How do you take it I say, Do I have a choice Do I have a choice We deal with a lot of bad people, but were winning. And every once in a while, Ill have one of these days where Im hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, Oh, its COVID. Its this again. By the way, its a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, Kung flu. I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, Where do you get the energy I say, I dont have a choice. I dont have a choice. It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you mightve seen it. So last week they called me and they say, Sir, West Point, West Point, were ready. I said, Oh, thats right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point. Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, Sir, were ready to go. I say, Lets go. This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, its beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, Sir, are you ready Yes, I am. So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I dont know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I dont know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet Or maybe therell be in groups of two. Would you like to salute Like this Yes. Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say its like a workout without a weight, right 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If Im off by two minutes theyll say, He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, hes a liar. These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, Thank goodness. Thank you very much. Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, Sir, are you ready I said, Im ready General, where are we going now You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now its sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said,  Sir, we can now leave the stage. I said, Great general, lets go, Ill follow you, and he goes like this, Right here, sir, and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, General. Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. Theyre incredible, and they do. I said, General, Ive got myself a problem, general. Because Im wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if youre walking on flat surfaces. Its not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, General, I have a problem, and he didnt understand that at first. I said, Theres no way. He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. Im being baked. Im being baked like a cake. I said, General, theres no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing. Its true. So I said, Is there like something else around Sir, the ramp is ready to go. Grab me sir, grab me. I didnt really want to grab him. You know why Because I said, That will be a story too. So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till Im rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really  Its an ice skating rink, its brutal. So I said, General, get ready because I may grab you so fast. Because I cant fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. Its true, right I dont want that, general. Now hes standing there, big strong guy, and hes got these shoes but theyre loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, Okay, general, lets go. I will only grab you if I need you. Thats not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right I was really bent over too. I didnt like that. I didnt like this picture. This picture Im sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, General, Im sorry, and I ran down the rest, right I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldnt want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, Here was the number one trending story. I call my wife, I said, How good was that speech I thought it was a  Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, Im average, but were having fun, were having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, How good was it, darling She said, Youre trending number one. I said to our great first lady, I said, Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that Im trending number one Because I felt it was really good. No no, they dont even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinsons disease. Its true. Its true. Its true. They say there is something wrong with our president. Ill let you know if theres something wrong, okay Ill let you know if theres something, Ill tell you what, theres something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, Well it wasnt only the ramp. Did you have water I said, Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didnt want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit. Youre drinking, youre working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the suns like this. This way they save on lighting, right Thats why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, What does it have to do with water They said, You couldnt lift your hand up to your mouth with water. I said, I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so whats the problem She said, Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie thats sort of expensive. Its silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I dont want to get water on the tie, and I dont want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. Its so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. Theyre bad people. Bad people. Okay, thats enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now were getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didnt have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didnt do too well in hurting Christopher, did they Thank you to our Italian population, were very proud of you, right Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and Im a big believer in freedom of speech, but thats desecration, thats a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we dont have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist  Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, Oh, the protesters were lovely. Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle Theyd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what theyve done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now theyre wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, Ill help you, Ill do whatever you want. Im waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, itll take less than an hour and itll all be over with and youll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs You know what he says to his wife when hes not confusing her with his sister Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy. Thats what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times Ill make like a speech and Ill have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didnt  Itll say, A comment from Joe Biden, but he didnt say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and theyll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, Joe didnt say that. Joe doesnt even understand it. wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People dont realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week Sir, would you sign for this plane Now its actually two planes. Would you sign for this plane Air Force One I said, How old is the original or the one we have now Sir, its 31, 32 years. Id see people coming in from foreign lands that cant compete with us, rich countries but they cant compete with the  They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do . This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but were still riding high because you know what On November 3 were going to win. Were going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, No no no, we want 5.6 billion, whatever it was. Whatever it was, if Im a little bit off theyll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. 5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, Cancel the contract. I want it canceled. I said, General, can you cancel the contract He said, Yes sir, Im very proud of it. Oh good. Cancel it. Okay sir. By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir. How much is it, general 250 million. I said, What Sir, we made a good deal. 250 million to kill. You mean if we dont buy the plane we have to hand them 250 million. Thats not good, right Look at these two guys, theyre looking. By the way, thats like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, 250 million Or I always say this, or around that number, because if Im off by a little bit, they say, Oh, he exaggerates. I look at numbers all day long. Thats what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. 250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great  I say, General. Dont cancel. Dont cancel. Just tell them I dont want the planes. Dont put anything in writing, dont put it in writing, general. Why sir Because I dont want to pay 250. True. You hear that Jim Jim Inhofe, hes great. You hear that Jim You know that story. He does a great job. So heres what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, No way, no way, no way. The next week they say, No way were doing it. The next week they said, How about 5 billion I said, No way. No way. The next week they said, 4.8. I said, Nope. Its got to have a 3 at the front of it. Dont you understand, you dumb son of a bitch Dont you understand I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, 4.5 is our best offer. Nope. Im not doing it. Im not doing it. Come back when youre ready. A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at 4 billion. Thats a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because theyre not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, Lets get it down from 50,000.00 to 25,000.00 because theyre delinquent. For many years theyre delinquent. They havent been paying what theyre supposed to be paying. Theyre paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number, and they say, Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, No, Angela, please. Dont say that Angela. Its true. You know who Im talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, Angela, thats a long time, this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, No Angela, thats not working. But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, Well, what about the last 25 years All the money you owe us Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasnt paid. I said, What about the trillion dollars that you really owe So were negotiating lets see, but in the meantime, were reducing our troops. Remember this, were supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country were supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. Were supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people dont get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. Were ripped off by so many countries and were stopping it. And that means that a lot of people dont want me here. They dont want me. There are a lot of people that dont want me. They dont sell a lot of bombs when were not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right Its called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nations Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, Get them in. After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. Were not happy. Thats going to be very expensive for DC. Theyre always looking for money. We need more money. We always need more money. And then they dont do the proper job. So its not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Dont worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didnt like what he said a week ago. I said, Where did that come from in the middle of the summer Nobodys even asking We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didnt like that. A lot of people that you wouldnt even think would care that much. Ive had people that I said, These are super left liberals and they didnt like it. Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, were doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobodys coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that youve ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, theyre not looking to do you much help. ICE, theyre rough guys. theyre great Americans, but theyll walk into, they caught them in a pack. Theyll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldnt say this, its not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybodys swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. Theyre great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, Theyre animals. And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because its more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, These are animals. And Nancy Pelosi said, These are human beings. Theyre not animals. If I lose an election over that, you know what This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Bidens America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And thats true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos youre seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we dont keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Bidens record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know whats great President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. Hes been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Bidens supported every globalist attack on the American worker lets make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, We have to make this deal with South Korea. Its going to mean 250,000 jobs. And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesnt know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didnt say it. And they didnt cover it. They didnt cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, thats closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. Thats early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. Hell always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. Thats been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the worlds top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently We killed this number one, terrorist. He didnt like it. You know why he didnt like it Because he thought it would be good politically, that didnt work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think its a little bit Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now theyre paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so theyre okay. Are you okay Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. Thats incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And thats why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, Im going to make a very fast deal. The best deal youve ever seen. Ive already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them 150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his sons paid 83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. 83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. Theyll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term thats perfect and theyre not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They dont want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as youre sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto ORourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you wont have to think back about it too much, because it wont matter. Hopefully it wont matter. No, Beto ORourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, thats not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like its never been before. And thats after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didnt have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess its a, I dont know if its an equal court, its almost like were a minority court, right Its almost like were a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. Well lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, youre the elite. Theyre not the elite. Youre the elite. Somebody two days ago said, Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you. I said, Yeah, why do you call them the elite, I said, why Well, theyre not elite. I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, well do it one more time. We wont even toy with them about three or four more times. We wont. Well do it one more time. Well be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But Ill be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And Ill choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And Ill only pick from that list. Biden cant release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldnt be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People dont understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, You won, but you have to come back and redo it. Its almost like, Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good. But were going to be refiling, but dont let it get you. Everythings going to work out really good. Everythings going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, Oh, youre going to win DACA. Youre going to win DACA. Thats easy. You got to win DACA. Thats easy. They all said it. And they came back and they said, We dont like what you did with your paperwork, essentially. So were re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didnt lose. Were going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom arent so young anymore, by the way. But were going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesnt even know where the hell he is. Lets face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free Not good, right Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I dont think thats going to work out too well, but shes actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesnt even want to win. She doesnt want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because shes got no sense, no credentials. Shes got a little charisma, not much, but she doesnt have a clue. You know it. But shes in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Lets cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I dont think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now shes telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think were going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because theyve had it. Theyve had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the mans personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who hes never met. And he frankly probably doesnt want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone elses jobs too by the way. If I didnt come along, were building auto plants, were building everything. And theres never been a comeback like were making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesnt wanted to Remember the picture of the cage A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they dont- And they dont want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. Theyre not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. Theyve done a terrible job and they shouldnt be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldnt happen. Itll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. Weve all worked too hard. They dont know what the hell theyre doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. Ive done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Bidens retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. Theyre respected by everybody. They do some job, and Id have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this.

Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man whos got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. Theyre great They are, theyre warriors. Ill tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and well send Jim Inhofe back, and well send all of them. Youll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and theyve been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess Im right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybodys ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what were doing is were doing it again. And its going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people dont quite get it. Were doing record business. Its happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So heres whats going to happen. Heres whats going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didnt stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Heres whats happening. Were going up. Were going up. Were going up. Were going to go up. Then were going to hit October. Were going to be up. Were going to be way up. Were not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But were going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what hes doing. I dont believe the fake news anymore. And youre not going to want to lose your 401ks. And youre not going to want to lose all of that wealth that youve accumulated, whether its real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because itll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So Im not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, were going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year were going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that weve ever had, okay And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you dont have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you dont have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I dont think I want to take a chance. Youre not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, its the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor. And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right Darling, I love you so much. Youve always been a loser. Youve always lost money. But now under President Trump, youre one of the greatest financial minds in our country. And all you did was keep your stock Whats wrong with having these great economic numbers Whats wrong with having to close it down We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, lets go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. Hes a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now its time to open up, get back to work, okay Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like theyve never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and 100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. Im also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So were going to do that. Itll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. Its very popular, but some people its like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know its wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. Its a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate thats over 30%. Theyre controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels youd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Thats whats happening, thats whats happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought theyd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And well always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. Thats a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, theres something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone. I said, Thank you very much. And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. Its so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. Thats happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasnt President, would have never come. We will become the worlds premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. Thats already started. Were bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill Americas terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. Sir, weve just taken 100%. We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, its damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right You couldnt sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, well protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, In God we trust. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you."
NewHampshire,Aug28,2020,"Hello, everybody. Hello, everybody. Wow. Hello, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. And Ill tell you, were landing and there are thousands of people along the runways, and I said, Why arent they here Sir, we couldnt let them in. Why not Lets let them in. Oh, these people. And then they put in a floor. This is for Manchester because you know about flooring. They put in a floor thats like an ice skating rink. So were going to tiptoe around. How are you, everybody We love you. We love you. Great, great people. Manchester, we had some good memories in Manchester. 2016, but this is going to be, we are right now in the most important election in our history. But Im thrilled to be back in the Granite State with the true hard-working American Patriots. Last night it was my great honor to accept the Republican nomination for President of the United States. Were going to win. Were going to win. Does anybody have any doubt Does anybody Its very interesting, last night we had an incredible time and I dont know if you know, its driving the fake news crazy. Theyre back. But the poll numbers have swung. If you go back six months before the plague flew in from China, the plague, the horrible plague, this election was over. This election was over. And then I had to go back to work. I had to go back to work. And then I went back to work and weve done an incredible job in every aspect of running government, but I also had to start campaigning a little bit again, and I did. And today it was announced that Joe Biden is coming out of the basement. Because the poll numbers have totally swung. They totally swung. And theyve swung like nobodys ever seen them swing before. And it was rapid. It was a rapid swing. Because they all admit that were doing a great job. Theres not too many presidents that have done a job like weve done, including keeping you out of wars, bringing you home from the endless wars. But theyve swung. But heres what I dont get. Sleepy Joes coming out he said in 10 days, thats a long 10 days. 10 days. Thats like an eternity in Trumpville. 10 days. I view 10 days is like an eternity, okay So he decided hes coming out and hes going to be out in 10 days. Thats a long time. Thats a big percentage of the remaining time. Thats all right, hes much better off where he is. I think hes, I think he just And how about those stories from friends of mine How about those stories Was that just compelling and incredible television, but really that was an exciting, a really good quality convention. Really great. So many people. So many people, you saw some tragic situations, some really great endorsements, you saw everything. If you How about the endorsement of Herschel Walker When you watch that that was from the heart. That was from the heart. Dana White today. I just saw it today because last night I was looking at this speech a little bit. We had a wonderful turnout last night. What I didnt like, you saw this right, when it was over, you saw when it was over The thugs outside because the Democratic mayor of Washington DC, its another Democrat thats not believing in law and order. And you know we give Washington DC a lot of money to run it, but they dont do a good job of running it. The mayor, she doesnt run anything. And these incredible people from all over the country, all over the world that were there last night, they walked out to a bunch of thugs. And that wasnt, remember this, that wasnt friendly protesters. They were thugs. They were thugs. And the DC police are good, but the mayor gave bad instructions last night, that should have never been allowed to happen. When a senator like Rand Paul walks out, and thank God we had some good police around him and they took a tremendous They took tremendous abuse. And Rand Paul was in big trouble last night, hes a good guy, hes a friend of mine, and that shouldnt happen to anybody. But he is a US senator walking outside and those four policemen should be brought over to the White House and we ought to give them a medal of some kind, and were going to do it. Were going to do it. I told that to Rand. And the mayor should be ashamed of herself for that kind of a display of incompetence because thats whats happening in Portland. And thats whats happening all over where you have Democrat-run cities. Just take a look. And were looking at the whole situation in DC, and tonight they have a lot of people gathering, lets see how that works out. They have to be able to manage their affairs, they get a lot of money. Shes always looking for money, Could we have more money What are you going to waste it on I mean spend it on. What are you going to waste it on, Mayor And then our people walk out, and these are people from all over the world, they walk, including Congress, by the way, they walk out and they get accosted, they get abused, they get spit on. Its a disgrace. And our country is going to change. Were not going to allow that to happen. You know, were not supposed to be Were not supposed to be involved unless were invited in by the people that run, these are all Democrat cities, just so you understand, including DC. So were not supposed to go in unless we call it an insurrection, but thats a big statement. Its a big statement. No reason for it. But you know what were going to do Were going to have to look at it. Mark Meadows is here, were going to have to look at it because were not going to let that happen to people that go to the White House to celebrate our country. And a weak guy named Joe Biden, and hes weak, hes weak as hell, a weak guy like Joe Biden didnt even bring law and order up as a subject for discussion in the entire Democrat National Convention. Now theyre all of a sudden Now they realize because theyve gone down like a rock in water, theyve gone down in the polls and now all of a sudden theyre talking all, Well, we have to talk about crime. Number one, they have no Look at what happened to New York, look at whats going on in Chicago, all Democrats, all radical left Democrats. Look at whats going on in the great State of Wisconsin. Now I will tell you, two days ago we sent in the National Guard. That was the end of that problem. Look at Portland. We want to send in the National Guard, we sent in Homeland Security just to protect our couple of our buildings, including a courthouse, can you believe it We sent in because-  couple of our buildings, including a courthouse. Can you believe it We send in because they cant protect it. So we sent, they did a very effective job. We could take care of Portland in 45 minutes, 45 minutes. If that governor, if that mayor would call and say, Please send in the National Guard. just like  Hey, we did it in Minneapolis. Remember that The place was going to burn down. Another few days, we send in the National Guard, it was over within an hour. They ought to get smart and thats what they ought to do. So now theyre talking about, Well, we want to  Why did they call it a friendly protest Right Remember the idiot from CNN, hes standing there. This is a friendly protest. Behind him over his shoulders, the entire city is burning down. Sixty seven days from now, were going to win the great state of New Hampshire. We have to. Were going to win four more years in the White House. Within my first term in office, weve secured Americas borders, brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt the United States military. It was a mess. It was a depleted mess. Wiped out the ISIS caliphate, killed our terrorists enemies, kept America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. Achieved American energy independence. You see the price of your gasoline. When you go fill it up, Oh boy, thats a nice price. Its half what it was. We built the single greatest economy in the history of the world. That includes China, which was having a very, very bad year. Then the plague came in from China. We had to close it up. We saved millions of lives and now were open again and were setting records. Were setting records. Wait till you see the numbers just before the election. Therell be released and this is despite the fact that the Democrats are holding back Michigan, North Carolina. You take a look. Pennsylvania. They want to keep them. By the way, on November 4th, regardless, theyll be opening them up, November 4th, because they think that hurts the economy and that will hurt me, but our numbers are going to be great. Were going to have a great third quarter. Were going to have an unbelievable next year, unless somebody stupid gets elected and raises your taxes. This November, each of you will vote in truly the most important election in the history of our country. I used to say it about 2016. This is now at a new level. Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to obliterate and destroy everything that you hold here including your second amendment, which will have no chance. Your vote will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow Biden to eliminate your jobs. By the way, its not Biden. Its not Biden. Its his masters, his  They tell him what to do, his masters. They want to erase your borders, confiscate your guns, appoint radical left judges and prosecutors, tear down our history. Demolish your suburbs. You saw what I did. I ended the rule. Youre not going to have low income housing built in your suburbs anymore, but nobody writes that because the fake news doesnt want to write that, but everyone knows. Unless our friends in the suburbs have gotten a lot dumber than they used to be, they know that. They want to destroy your suburbs, indoctrinate our children, defund the police and try everything in the book to turn our cities so that they look more like Portland, Oregon than what were used to looking at. Never forget, they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. Its true. Todays Democrat party is filled with hate. Just look at Joe Biden supporters on the streets screaming and shouting at bystanders with unhinged manic rage. Right You see it. Its crazy. Its crazy. You ought to see last night in Washington. It was a disgrace. It was a disgrace that these people are representing the United States of America. It was a disgrace. Protesters. You know what I say Protest is your ass. I dont talk about my ass. Theyre not protestors. Those arent  Those are anarchists. Theyre agitators. Theyre rioters. Theyre looters. Theyre not  You know you say that and some of the people, not all of them, but some of the people back there, Oh, how dare you. These are friendly protesters, right Friendly  Theyre just looking for trouble. Has nothing to do with George Floyd. Has nothing to do with anything. They dont even know who George Floyd is. Okay They dont know who George Floyd. They have no idea. If you ask them, Whos George Floyd They couldnt even tell you. These are just bad people, troublemakers and they shouldnt be representing our country at important events and weve got to stop it. Democrats have no complaint about the rioters and the vandals, marauding through our cities or mass unruly demonstrations, but they dont believe law abiding citizens can go to a church together. You cant go to church anymore. You know how many churches are closed in this country because of the Democrats You can go out and you can have thousands of people marauding through the streets, threatening other people, beyond threatening, kicking them in the face, doing what theyve done. Youve seen it. They would have done that to Senator Rand Paul last night. Hed either be in very bad shape or dead and that would include his wife if those policemen didnt happen to be there. They took some big beating. The reason they didnt fight back too much, they dont want to lose their pension. They dont want to lose their job, because weve become so politically correct, everybodys afraid to do anything now, but they did a good job. The puppet Biden, whos just controlled so strongly wants you to cancel weddings, funerals and school, but has no problem with thousands of so-called peaceful protesters cramming into your streets, mugging people, hurting people, robbing stores, looting stores, burning down storefronts. The radical left will do anything to get power. They smear justice, Brett Kavanaugh, and they are  Did you see anything like that Justice Kavanaugh. People forget. Time goes by, they forget. We dont forget. I dont forget. Theyre destroying the livelihoods of innocent people and if Biden wins, which I honestly cant believe can happen. I will have lost to a low IQ individual. I dont want that. I dont want it. Sleepy Joe, I dont want it. But the agitators will go from rioting in the streets to running the halls of government. Can you believe it The levers, they call it the levers of government. The top 10 most dangerous cities in America are run by Democrats and have been for decades. Now theyre trying to impose those policies across the entire country. No one will be safe in Bidens America. I cant even call it Bidens America. God doesnt know hes alive. Hes going to be out in 10 days. Hes going to start 10 days. Ten days. I mean, I gave a big speech last night. I said, What am I doing tomorrow night Youre going to New Hampshire, but sir, we can cancel New Hampshire because you had a big night. We can cancel. Are you crazy I dont have the courage to cancel New Hampshire. I got to win New Hampshire. I love the people and youve been very good to me. Youve been very good to me. Youve been very good to me. So, New Hampshire was the first state I won. Right Remember, I came here. I was very excited. That was an exciting evening. That was an exciting race, but we dont talk about that anymore. We have to talk about the future. We dont talk about it. That was great. It was important. Weve done more than any administration in its first three and a half years in the history of our country. Thats despite phony witch hunts, phony investigations, a phony impeachment based on a phone call that was absolutely perfect. Thats despite a pandemic that was probably sent in by China, who the hell knows how it got here and all over the world, because China does not want to see me win I can tell you that. Were not happy with China. Ill tell you why. If Biden got in, China would own the United States very quickly. Theyd own it. If the Democrat party wants to stand with anarchist, criminals, rioters, looters, and flag burners, thats up to them. The Republican party and you, I can see you. Is there anybody in this place that enjoys burning the American flag Is there anybody Please quietly raise your hand. Be careful. Could be very dangerous. The Republican party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and our law enforcement. Right We are all that stand between the American people and the left wing mob. If you want to save democracy from the mob, then you must vote to defeat an extremely poor candidate. Look, I believe I have the honor of running against the worst candidate ever put up by the Democratic party, the worst. How do you get worse I believe hes the worst candidate, the slowest candidate. I mean, in prime time, he was the slowest candidate, which was a long time ago. Primetime. You know what I dont like though, they say hes like 78, 79, 78, I guess. Right I know people that are 85, that are 88, 92, Bernie Marcus, Home Depot, hes 92 years old. Hes the sharpest guy youll ever meet. Theres nothing  78 is okay, but thats a bad 78, not a good 78. 78 is okay, but he shouldnt say that. They shouldnt say  The press, they say hes too old. Hes not too old. Hes not too old, but 78 is okay, but I do. I know people in their 90s that are 100% sharp and good physically, actually good physically. You want debate So do I. I want debates too. I want debates too. Tonight, were honored to be joined by New Hampshire House Republican leader, Dick Hinch. Where is Dick I think your great governor is here.

You can go over at taxes and you can go over what weve done with the military. We passed the biggest tax cuts ever, ever the history of our country. Now, they want to raise taxes. Think of it. All my life, Ive watched politicians. Dont forget, Ive only been doing this for four and a half years. I havent been to  Ive had senators come in. Ive had congressmen come in. Sir, Ive been doing this for 25 years and in 25 years Ive only lost three races, sir. I said, But Ive only been doing it for four years and I only won one race, but now I have to win two. One race I won, but it was the president. It was for president. It was for president, but we did the largest tax cut in the history of our country. We eliminated the most job destroying regulations in the history of our country. I ended the job killing Paris climate accord. That was a killer. That was meant to hurt the United States. By the way, in case you had any questions. Today, the United States is the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth. To give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures we passed and hopefully anybody here doesnt need it. Nobody here. Uh-oh, do you need it Uh-oh.

We took out al-Baghdadi. I wish I were president, you would had a different solution. Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead. How about you Yeah. Well talk to you later. Right to try. You have no idea. So many people, they used to travel all over the world to get a cure. Now, we can sign a quick simple document. It sounds easy, it wasnt, but it was easy for me. I understood it. Now, you signed a document. We give you the greatest medicines even if they havent been approved. If somebodys terminally ill, like in the case of your wife, if somebodys terminally ill, at least you have hope, but its beyond that because people have gone home. You have to see some of the results have been incredible. You saw one of the people the other day, right That wonderful young lady that was so incredible and spoke so well. Shes a special person. She really is a special person. Thank you. Well talk to you. Thank you very much. To bring opportunities to our inner cities, I signed the groundbreaking criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. True. Before the China virus came in, before that China virus came in, we had the best job numbers ever recorded the history of our country. We had almost 160 million Americans working. We had never had numbers like that. The Republican party is the party of Abraham Lincoln. Remember that. We- We stand for so much, including Martin Luther Kings dream of a nation where our children are judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. You know that. The radical lefts effort to divide everyone by race tears us apart. Theres so much racial hatred, and its put there by CNN, by MSDNC They stoke the flames and they know it. The good news is the ratings arent great. So thats okay. They dont have great ratings. But they stoke the flames. Uh-oh, CNN just turned off their camera again. They always turn off their camera. Why do I keep doing that Every time I do it, they turn off their camera. They did it last time. I mention CNN, theyre screaming, turn the camera off. Our movement is about a brighter future for all Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the African American community. Ive spent the last four years delivering for the African American community like nobody, with the exception possibly of Abraham Lincoln, has delivered before. Its true. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from the last administrations horrible, stupid, insane Trans Pacific Partnership. Wouldve destroyed the US auto industry and many other industries. New Hampshire lost one in four, and I think much more than that, manufacturing jobs following twin disasters of NAFTA and Chinas entrance into the WTO. It was more than one in four. That statistic is wrong. Please have it changed. The statistic is wrong, far more than one in four. Earlier this year, I kept my promise and replaced the NAFTA nightmare with a brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. They said that couldnt be done. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to Chinas pillaging and plundering of American jobs. Joe Bidens agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in America. After years of building up other nations, we are finally building up our nation and our jobs, and were taking care of our people. Last night, I got great reviews of the speech and all, but some of the fakers back there, they said, Well, it was a little long. He shouldnt have used the White House. Oh really Tell me. But they said it was a little Then one person, I think it was Chris Wallace. Nice guy. Hes actually a nice guy. He said that, He didnt have the same energy in the speech that he usually has. Well, its a different kind of a speech. Tonight, Im in New Hampshire and we can wing it. See, actually, actually Chris, who has always wanted to be his father, but it never worked out because of a lack of talent. Actually though, actually Chris has it wrong. If I did last nights speech here, by now you would have all been walking out. And if I did tonights speech there, I would have been criticized by being slightly radical. But were having a good time doing it this way, right Because we are finally putting America first. Under my administration, Americas borders are more secure than ever before. We ended the catch and release, stopped asylum fraud. And we have deported 20,000 gang members and 500,000 criminal aliens. Weve already built 300 miles of border wall and were adding 10 new miles every single week. The wall will soon be completed. And our numbers on the border are the best theyve ever been. And by the way, Mexico is paying for the wall. Just in case you didnt know that. They dont know that. Theyre paying for the wall. You havent noticed on the wall. Everything was wall, wall. They didnt think I was going to get it done. Because look, you have one major party controlling Congress and they dont want to give me a wall. So theyre going crazy. Wall. The walls not getting done. Then I get it done. Get it from the military, get it from everything. Im a developer. I know how to get money. Its one of those. Developers understand. And now that the wall is almost complete, itll be soon complete. And its the wall that border security wanted so badly. This is the one. But now that its built, you never hear about the wall. They dont talk about it anymore. They dont talk about it anymore. Its incredible. But the wall will soon be complete. Weve invested 2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in nearly 75 years. The space force. And Al, in honor of you, we have passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, Al. That guys been bugging me for years. Al has been bugging me. Whats in that hat, Al Let me see. Let me Its something. Al, hes been bugging me for years. Did you ever think wed get VA Choice, VA Accountability Did you ever really believe it Thank you, Al. I withdrew from the last administrations disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, a disaster. 150 billion we paid Iran for a basically short term deal. And we gave them Whats more impressive, we also gave them 1.8 billion in cash. Cash. Many plane loads. You know what that took Many, many plane loads, 1.8 billion. I said bad. Thats when I realized how powerful a president is in the United States. When a president has the right, which by the way, I dont believe he did have that right, okay When a president has the right to go into the banks and take out 1.8 billion and hand it to people that hate our guts, thats power. Thats power. I dont believe he had the right to do it. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the US embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East in 25 years. You saw that just last week. UAE, highly respected. Mohamed, highly respected. UAE and Israel. And now theyre all going to be coming in. Now theyre all saying, How come you didnt tell us about this Youll have peace in the Middle East. And yet were moving our trips out. Its pretty amazing, actually. Well get no credit for it, but thats all right. Remember that Kaitlan. Cover that properly, Kaitlan. We like Kaitlan. Together, weve spent the last four years cleaning up 47 years of Biden disasters. Joe Biden has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. He supported NAFTA. Chinas entry. Hes done so many things. This man, if you look at what hes done, we went into a deal, the Korea, you know about the Korea deal Hillary Clintons deal, along with Biden. They promised 250,000 jobs, right 250,000 jobs. And they were right. Except all those jobs went to South Korea. They didnt come to us. 00, the polls close. And they said, Donald Trump has won the state of Texas. Simultaneously with the closing. Im now running in Texas against a man whos against oil, guns, and God. How do you win Texas I said this, you could bring George Washington back as your Presidential candidate. You could bring Abraham Lincoln. Lets put him as the Vice Presidential candidate. Run in Texas and other states, you couldnt win. You couldnt win. Now, theyre not going to win. Were going to win this. And youre against the oil stuff too. Because his whole thing on oil, no fracking, no this, no that. New England has the highest energy costs in the United States. And you know why Because Governor Cuomo will not let a pipeline go across the tip of New York State so that oil and gas, of which we have plenty, can come. And do you know where you buy your energy from Russia. Did you know that You have ships, much of it from Russia, because Governor Cuomo, New York wont allow a pipeline and theyre desperate to have something happen in upper New York State. And those are great people, but theyve been treated very badly. But they wont allow a pipeline. By not allowing a pipeline, were trying to do it through essentially eminent domain. By not allowing a pipeline to go through upper New York State and create a lot of jobs for them, you have the highest energy prices in the United States by far. Thank you New York. Thank you. Thank you Governor Cuomo. Biden voted for the Iraq war. I was against the Iraq war. He opposed a mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani. You remember that one He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and for the world. Thats not a positive development. Before they went into the WTO, China was flat lined. For years and years and decades, flat lined. And then they got into the WTO and a lot of bad things happened. First Chinas stole our jobs, plundered our intellectual property and unleashed the virus. And now China is trying to just hug and kiss Joe Biden. They want him so badly. Look, if you like China, you should vote for Biden, that I can tell you. How about his son You think the son, maybe theres a conflict How about his son Wheres Hunter Where is Hunter Where is Hunter Does anybody know Wheres Hunter Hes in another country right now, probably, ripping off another country. No, as soon as Biden became vice president, bad things happened with respect to a Hunter. If that happened with respect to my family, I wouldnt be standing. I guarantee you that. I guarantee you that. What a disgrace. What a disgrace. Ukraine. And its not just Ukraine and its not just China. But he goes into China, takes out 1.5 billion to manage, and he knows nothing, and he wasnt even employed. He got thrown out of the armed services. So give me a break. Its a disgrace, whats happening. Theres a double Theres a thing happening with the media like nobodys ever seen before. These people right here. Because if that happened to a Republican, in particular. If any of that stuff happened to me, it would be brutal. But it happened to him. They dont want to talk about it. And how about the questions asked by Anderson Cooper yesterday Anderson Cooper. Hes interviewed me a lot over the years and I always got along with him, but they were tough interviews. Did you hear the questions And Biden kept looking down. I think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter. Right I think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter. And thats happened before. And how about David Muir of ABC Hes a nice guy, right How soft were those questions How soft were those They dont ask me questions like that. They got fire pouring out of their eyes. No. Mr. Vice President, what do you think of this How was your breakfast, sir Did you enjoy it When I banned travel from China Biden, called it hysterical and xenophobic. He even used, somewhere along the line, the word racist. He always figures, they always want to get that word in there. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. But instead my decision, saved thousands and thousands of lives. And then we banned Europe very early because I saw what was going on, really in Italy and Spain and France. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Mike Pence did a great job. We produced more than 100,000 ventilators within weeks. And not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, not one. You heard all about, and now were producing ventilators. Hard to produce. Expensive, complex. Were producing them now for the rest of the world. 188 countries were affected by this. We pioneered advances in treatment that have reduced the monthly rate. And you look at this, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since April. Think of that. 85% since April. Under Operation Warp Speed, three different vaccines are right now in final stage trials. If you go back three years, that would have been something that would have been impossible to even discuss. It would have taken years. We will produce a vaccine this year and together we will defeat the virus. Its already getting defeated. And by the way, another big Democrat hoax. Another big hoax. I want football back. Im the one thats been saying. Is that a correct statement I want football back. These are young, strong guys. Theyre not going to be affected by the virus. If you look at it, its generally older people. Older people that have heart conditions, that have diabetes, that have problems. These are big strong guys. Theyll be just fine. But I want football back. Ive been calling for football to be back, including Big 10. Big 10, get with it. Open up your season, Big 10. And the Dems dont want it back for political reasons. But now their new line This is like Russia, Russia, Russia. All this crap they come up with. Now their new line is they are trying to blame me and keep football shut down. They want to keep it shut down. And theyre saying that President Trump shut it down. Im the one that wants it open. So theyre reversing it. Theyre playing a big con game. Its just a con game. And thats what were dealing with. And we have to defeat them on November 3rd. I want football back and Big 10 open. And now the other day, Joe Biden came up with a plan to impose a blanket shutdown. Hed be willing to do another blanket. And we had to do it. We blanket, we shut down. We saved millions of lives. Instead of the number we have today, 175,000, we could have had 2 million today instead. It would have been unacceptable, unsustainable. Unsustainable. We did everything right. We did it right. We closed it down. We stopped China. We stopped Europe. Now were opening it up and were opening it up to record numbers, despite the fact that the Democrats are keeping their states shut down and hurting people that live in those states, shut down as long as possible. But now Biden wants to do another blanket shutdown, possibly, that would decimate the economy and cause suicides, drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, heart attacks, joblessness. Youd have jobs, all of the problems that it causes. Because its not just a one sided equation. A shut down causes big problems also. And at this point, when the economy is roaring back. We had record job numbers this last quarter, over 9 million jobs. Were going to throw that all out We have a market You know, your stock market. Who has 401ks here Your 401ks and your stocks, when you have stocks, would be obliterated. And right now, we have just, on two of your markets, as you know, SP and NASDAQ, youre at new records. And youre about to hit another new record. Think of it. Who would have thought the stock market And hopefully were at the end of this horrible China virus. Came from China. They should have stopped it and they did. But who would have thought, just who would have thought that the stock market is at record levels right now Record levels. And everything else is going to follow. Before the virus, we created an economic miracle and now were doing it again. We did the Paycheck Protection Program where we saved more than 200,000 jobs in New Hampshire alone. 200,000, right Over the past three months, weve gained so many different, if you look at retail numbers. Take a look at our retail numbers. Theyre literally at records. Look at some of the numbers be announced by companies. Theyre at records. Can you imagine giving that all up and starting again Its not acceptable. If Im reelected, we will create 10 million jobs over the next 10 months, and well do that easily. The Biden agenda, with big tax increases and big regulation increases, would immediately kill everything. You will go into a depression. And Im very good at predicting this. You will go into a depression the likes of which this country has not seen since 1929, and who knows, maybe worse than that. They are playing a suicide mission.  be worse than that. They are playing a suicide mission if they want to raise your taxes. They want to raise your taxes by 4 trillion. And thats going to be almost everybody. Theyre saying for the rich. No, not for the rich. Theyre going to be raising everybodys taxes almost. Joe Biden is running on the most extreme far left platform of any nominee in American history and of our foreign adversaries, were devising a plan to destroy the United States from within. All they have to look is at the Biden Harris. How about her Is she a beauty What a beauty that is. They pick a woman who starts off She starts off sort of strong. Shes one of the favorites. Within a period of a few months, she goes down, down 15, 12, 11, nine, eight, five, three, two. Then she goes, Im going to leave because Ive decided that I want to leave. I want to leave. She left because she wouldnt have gotten any votes. She was terrible. This would be your president possibly. I dont think so. I dont think so. I want to see the first woman president also, but I dont want to see a woman president get into that position the way she do it and shes not competent. Shes not competent. Theyre all saying we want Ivanka. I dont blame them. They want to eliminate Americas borders in the middle of a pandemic, suspend all deportations, restore catch and release, and expand horrible, dangerous, disgusting sanctuary cities. They want to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers. Thats what we need is more lawyers. Lets get some more lawyers into the act. They want to end national security travel bands from jihadist nations, very dangerous, and increase refugee admissions by 700%. This is in the Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie, you know crazy Bernie. A lot of his people are going to vote for me just like they did last time. You know why Because of trade. Because I agree with Bernie Sanders, but my trade policies are much tougher than his and Im able to do it. All you have to do is how is China doing last year with my trade policy Not too well. And we had the best year weve ever had. Were going to get a lot of Bernie Sanders voters because they like my attitude on trade. They really like it because Ive been telling people for years our country is being ripped off by China and many other countries, including, I hate to say it, our allies. Our allies have been ripping us big. And you heard me say last night, NATO, I got 130 billion from them first time going up to 400 billion a year from NATO countries, by saying, You got to do it. You got to do it. And general Secretary Stoltenberg said it cant be done. He could not believe it. Hes actually my biggest fan and nobody ever calls him for a quote. Call him sometime. They want to abolish cash bail and cut funding for law enforcement. They want to end We want to increase law enforcement, not cut law enforcement. And by the way, Pat Lynch is a great guy, New York, New York. Really great, New Yorks finest, right Their rights have been taken away from them. Literally theyre not allowed to do their job, but Pay Lynch, he said the first time in history that they know of New Yorks finest have endorsed a candidate. The candidate is Donald Trump. First time theyve done it. All over the country, the sheriffs of Florida, all of Texas, all over the country, Ohio, law enforcements endorsing Trump. I cannot imagine them getting any law enforcement endorsements. If they do, please let me know and well have a little discussion. Well ask why did that happen They want to end school choice and ban charter schools. They want to abolish American energy, including all of the things I said before. And add to that coal and add to that shale. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, a bright future, the American dream for all Americans. There is no limit to what we can achieve with four more years. So in conclusion, I have to say this. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world thats happening already. We will end our reliance on China once and for all. Well do it here. Like we used to do in the good old days before we owed trillions of dollars. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and neighborhoods and ban sanctuary cities. We will kill our terrorists enemies as weve been doing while keeping America out of the endless foreign Wars. I go to Dover and I greet these incredible families of soldiers that have been so sadly killed. So sadly killed. Its such a shame. I go to the hospital, I go to Walter Reed Medical Center. Its incredible. The doctors are so talented. I see what they can do, but soldiers so badly hurt. And theyre really acting as police. Theyre acting as police. Now, were very low in Afghanistan now in terms of numbers of troops. Were getting out. Well be getting out soon. Were very low in Iraq. Were very low in Syria, except we kept the oil. We left some behind for the oil. If you dont mind, we kept the oil. We should have kept the oil in Iraq like Ive been saying. Well appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda, which is what we have in many cases right now. The next president will be in my opinion, responsible for two, three, four, and maybe, maybe even five US Supreme Court Justices. You better vote for me, you better vote for me or youre going to have the greatest depression youve ever seen. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Second amendment. We will surprise medical billing require, its already done. I signed it. Nobody can believe I did it. Price transparency. You know what that is Do you know how big that is Where youre able to actually negotiate with hospitals, see their prices, compare it. You know who likes it Good hospitals and good doctors. Other people dont like it. Its the biggest thing and nobody even talks about it, but Ive already put it into effect. The bad news is it goes into effect on January 1st. You better make sure you elect me so I get credit for it. Otherwise, could you imagine if sleepy Joe got in and medical prices and drug prices and everything had dropped, but he said, I wonder what happened And I did it all. Ill be so angry at New Hampshire. Ill never speak to you again. Now, all these things, what were doing with drugs, we instituted a favored nations laws. We instituted favored nations. Thats going to drop your prices 50, 60, 70%. And Im the only president in 51 years, last year, drug prices went down a little, not much, but they went down the first time in 51 years. Favored nations could drop at 50, 60, or 70%. On top of that, I instituted rebates where the rebates go toward price reductions and back to the customer instead of to a middleman. So we will protect Medicare and we will protect Social Security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful American flag. Do we love our American flag Or Mars. Above all, we will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history and be inspired by the words of the New Hampshire state motto. Have you ever heard of these words Live free or die. Live free or die. Vote for those people. And you do, you have a great governor. Vote for your people, vote for your governor. You have a great governor. From Portsmouth to Dixville from Concord to Keene. I know a friend from Keene. Great guy. I had a friend from Keene a long time. Keene, New Hampshire. And Merrimack to Manchester, we will fight for every job, every family and every neighborhood. We will fight for every vote. We have to win. We have no choice. Can I be honest with you Were working hard. Were all working. I dont have to do this. I could get off that beautiful plane that used to be black and white with a red stripe. That was mine. But thats Air Force one. I get off that beautiful plane. I could come up and say, Ladies and gentlemen of New Hampshire, you have no choice. You have to vote for me because if you dont, youll be put in radical lefties. Youll have a depression. Your stocks will be worthless. Your 401ks will be gone. Therell be crime all over your streets. So Im not going to work at all. Im leaving now, but you have to vote for me because you have no choice. Right I could say it. Right Right We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trail, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads. Won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the greatest nation in the history of the world and we are making it greater. We will be greater than ever before. Incredible citizens like you, the people of New Hampshire, helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are not going to let the radical left socialists or communists take our country. Were not going to let it. Were returning power to you the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one nation under God. And we dont take the beautiful word God out of our Pledge of Allegiance, do we They did it twice. They it twice. Then they say, Well, we didnt mean that. Oh, I see. I was listening once they said, Thats right. You dont know what it is, what happened What happened They did it on purpose. They did it twice. Thats where theyre coming from. You can be fools and you can be fooled, but thats where theyre coming from. So dont be surprised, but theyre not going to get there. Were not going to let it happen. Were not going to let our country be destroyed by a bunch of nut jobs. America will soon be thriving like never before and together with the people of New Hampshire that have meant so much to me, and I brought down opioid and I brought down drug problems for you by 19% and nobody even talks about it. 19. I talk about New Hampshire a lot because you had one of the proportionally worst problems of any country, of any state in this incredible country. You had one of the worst problems of any of the states. And I talk about you a lot. It was incredible. And you still have. But we brought it down 19% and people are absolutely shocked. If it werent for the China plague, the number would be 25 or 30%. That really hurt us because people sort of went back to some old ways because they dont want to be shut down any longer. Joe, dont you understand that They dont want to be shut down. So I worked very hard on that for this state and for other states, but this was a state that was so severely impacted with the drug problem. That wall is stopping them and its stopping them like never before. Its stopping them like never before. I want to thank New Hampshire for all youve done for me. I want to thank New Hampshire. You were my first victory, as I said, but you are going to lead a nation to the most important victory and the most important election that weve ever had. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you."
Henderson,Sep13,2020,"Thank you, thank you. Wow. Wow, and Im thrilled to be here with you in Henderson. Thousands of loyal, hard-working, great American patriots. And 51 days from now, were going to win Nevada, and were going to win four more years in the White House. And after we win four more years, well ask for maybe another four or so. Well, thank you very much. Whenever I say that  Look at all that news back there, look at all that fake news. When I say that, their heads explode. Our movement is pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-police, and 100% pro-American. As we begin tonight, our thoughts are with the two sheriffs deputies in Los Angeles who were fighting for their lives when a vicious criminal walked up to their vehicle and shot them at point blank range. Tonight, we send our love and our support to their families, and we pray to God for their recovery. The radical left in America is waging open war on law enforcement. Hundreds of officers nationwide have been injured in left-wing riots and mobs. You see it, you see it all the time. Please, sit down. Please, lets have a little fun. We got plenty of time. I mean, here it is. I mean, what do we have Football is boring as hell. Its just not the same. Right I dont know. Used to be people would say, Hey, could you keep it away from a football game Now theyre saying, Could you possibly do it during the football game We have some free time. But during violent demonstrations in Las Vegas, a 29-year-old police officer, you know this very well, was deliberately shot in the head, leaving the young, brave officer paralyzed, yet, Sleepy Joe Biden and his supporters continue their dangerous war on the police. Theyre putting the lives of our brave officers directly in harms way. At his convention, he never even mentioned the words, law and order, never mentioned them once. Now, hes all of a sudden, his polls are dropping like a rock, and hes starting to say, But we need law and order. And then he goes back into the basement for four days. What happens to this guy I know what happens to him. Hes shot. Thats what happened to him. Every once in a while, the great Dana White  Does anybody know Dana White Hes got some champions with him tonight. Hes here. I got to introduce him. But every once in a while, Ill ask him, What happened to that guy He said, Sir, hes been shot for the last  long time. Should have left a long time ago. Thats Joe Biden. Joe Biden, hes shot, and everybody knows it. And you know what They ought to be ashamed, because they do interviews with him, they give him the questions, and they let him read the answer from a teleprompter, and thats the fake news. It is. How about the other day Could you move that a little bit closer. See these things Move it a little bit. I must tell you at great peril, I used them seldom, but those are the times we have the best fun too, I will say. And thats actually when we learn the most. For the entire summer, Biden was silent as left-wing mobs assaulted police officers. When Bidens far-left supporters set fire to police cars and precinct stations, court houses, Joe Biden called them peaceful protestors. Right They call them peaceful protestors. And when we go to these radical-left place that are having problems, because everyone  look at the top-10. You go back  go top-20, top-30. Take a look. Democrat-run, radical left-wing, Democrat, usually run. Not Republican-run, Democrat-run. And we go back, and we take a look. We want to give them help. They dont want help. But when they do ask for help, and when they do, we go in. Like Minneapolis, the National Guard went in, took 35 minutes to quell a situation that went on for two weeks. They knew we were going in to Seattle. We told them, Were going in tomorrow morning. And so, they sent them in. They didnt want that to happen, and we let the protestors know, or whatever you call them. Theyre really anarchists, theyre not protestors. So we let the anarchists know that we were going in with approximately 10,000 very tough people, and they immediately raised their hands, and the Seattle police, who by the way, could do a great job if they were let to do their job, but theyre not, theyre not. And as you know, in Portland, the other day, we had to send in the US Marshalls. A man, whos a bad guy, bad guy, shot somebody right in the middle of the street, who they say was a very fine young man. Shot him, killed him. Just shot him like  It was on television. Two-and-a-half days, nothing happened. I said, Whats going on We sent in the US Marshalls. It was taken care of in 15 minutes. Okay 15 minutes. When asked if he would cut police funding, Sleepy Joe said, Absolutely, yes, I would. Now hes trying to change his mind. You ever see a guy  He changed his mind on fracking. Okay There will be no fracking. You know that He went all throughout the debates. He doesnt even know what fracking is, I guarantee you. He was told to say that by Bernie and the radical left and his vice president. By the way, how bad is she She is the worst. Were going to have a woman president some day. Not going to be her, not going to be her. And thats no way to attain the office. We got in there because Sleepy Joe couldnt handle it anymore. Joe is bad primetime. See, the reason I can talk so badly about him, because he did an ad, where he had me standing over the grave and the graves of our fallen heroes from many years ago, and they said  And nobody loves the military more. Look what Ive done for them, 2.5 trillion. And in the ad, they have me saying horrible things in front of other people. Nobody would have put up with that. Its called disinformation. They make up a total lie, they put it out, then they do ads. So once he did that, I said, Now, really, look, its okay. Its okay, because now the gloves are off. I can say that this man is totally unfit to be president. Up here, hes totally unfit. He cant be your president. Ive gotten to know President Xi of China. Ive gotten to know President Putin of Russia. And by the way, getting along with them is good. Although China, I must tell you, got a real problem with China. What they did with us, we can never forget that. We made a great trade deal. The ink wasnt dry when the plague came in from China. They stopped it from going into China, but they didnt stop it from going into our country, Europe and the rest of the world. Okay They could have done that. But you see, I deal with all of these people, and they dont have the kind of mental problem that Sleepy Joe has. Theyre very sharp. Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un doesnt know about the problems that Joe has. We need very sharp people. Im sorry. Joe is not qualified for this position. Joe calls for abolishing cash bail and closing your prisons. He wants to close prisons, and he even called law enforcement the enemy recently. You saw that The enemy, until his polls started dropping. Then all of a sudden, he said, No, we love law enforcement. I think Ive gotten every major law enforcement group in the country, right You saw recently, I got New Yorks finest. And they are New Yorks finest, but theyre not allowed to do their job. Theyre not allowed. We have a radical left mayor who has no clue. He has no clue whats happening to that poor city. I love that city. Whats happening to that city. 300% up. Look, 300% in certain very bad crimes, New York. Theres no reason for this, and we have the greatest police. Theyre great. New Yorks finest, they endorsed me. Chicago, Fraternal Order of Police. Chicago endorsed me, Oklahoma endorsed me, Texas endorsed me, Florida endorsed me. Every place endorsed me. And if you think its easy for New York and Chicago and these different places  Ohio endorsed me. If you think its easy for these guys. They never endorse. New York, they said they cannot remember ever having endorsed a presidential candidate. They endorsed me, and theyre against their radical left culture thats destroying the city. So I was very honored. But how about Chicago Do you think its easy for these great police in Chicago to endorse me Its not easy, but they felt that they had an obligation to do it. So it just happened. Im just very honored by it. And Bidens anti-police crusade must stop. Its got to stop, its got to stop now. Furthermore, the corporations, these poor, stupid people that run the  They got paid a lot of money. Theyre weak, ineffective people, lets face it. Theyre funding anti-police organizations and other organizations that are  Its so embarrassing. And I dont mean for a little. They gave 100 million and 250  Youre talking about serious money. Youre talking about serious money, and that money is not used for good reasons. And these stupid corporations  and theyll be the first to go if the radical left ever took  Theyd throw those guys out like they were nothing. If they were lucky, theyd just be thrown out. It would probably be a lot rougher than that. These people dont know what theyre getting into. But instead of giving money, they should give money to the families of the crime victims and the fallen officers. Thats what they should do. So in the Republican Party, we know that police officers are not villains, but the heroes who risk their lives to keep us safe. And they guard  The thing thats incredible  I know so many police, theyre so good, one bad apple, and theyre on for months. One bad apple, they go on for months. The thousands and tens of thousands of good things, nobody talks about it. These are great people that have done a great job, and we have to support our law enforcement. So Biden wants to appease the domestic terrorists, and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists. Okay And we also believe that if you murder a police officer, you should receive the death penalty, and thats something thats very important fine people. I mean, theyre in very grave condition, as you know. Fine people. Hes an animal, and I called him an animal, and I was criticized by people, calling him an animal. They said hes a human being. Hes not a human being. Hes an animal. Hes not a human being. Joe Biden opposes the death penalty even for cops who  I mean, look, you have to see, even for these cop killers who go around, the predators, they murder children. People like the Boston bomber. He opposes the death penalty for the Boston bomber. He wants to give prisoners a vote. He wants to have the Boston bomber be able to vote. I dont think so. I dont think so. I dont think so. You know whos thought of that Bernie Sanders, Crazy Bernie. He wants to have  Crazy Bernie, he says, No, no, they have to vote. So they asked him, Well, does that mean every   That means everybody thats in prisons should be entitled to a vote, right So they actually said, Well, what about the Boston bomber Should he entitled And Bernie goes, Yeah, he should be entitled. Bernie is crazy. But the fact is, that we got a lot of Bernie votes four years ago, because Bernies right about one thing, trade. Because all of these countries, friend and foe, they ripoff the United States. We have made so many great trade deals, and you see it, USMCA. We got rid of NAFTA. So many. But Biden is too weak to be president, and hes not a smart person. And by the way, he wasnt smart 25 years ago. Everybody knew it. Now we dont even have to discuss the matter. But I was going to say, when he put that ad up, we told him to take it down. When he put that ad up, that dishonored our fallen heroes. They are great, great heroes of mine, of yours, of everybodys. I know really bad people. No bad person, the worst person I know, I know some beauties from New York. I know some developers in New York actually. Nobody would say what they said. They made it up. It was a made up statement, and they put it up in the form an ad, from a third-rate magazine, whos best friend is Obama, who, by the way, got caught spying on my campaign. He got caught. We caught him cold. We have him cold. Now lets see what happens. Now the Republicans, its interesting, we have much better policy, but the Republicans, they dont fight like Colby. You know who Colby is. Youre going to say hello to Colby. They dont fight like Colby. They dont fight to win. Better policy, but they dont have that vicious streak. If this were reversed, they would be in jail for two years already, and it would be for a 50-year term for treason. Thats what it would be. Okay But Bidens too scared to stand up to the crazy socialists and never will. Hell never have the strength, and hes going downhill fast. Its going to be very interesting. And I called for a drug test, because you know what I want a drug test, because we dont want to have a situation like we could have with this guy. I watched him in debates with other 24 lunatics, and he was so bad. No, he was so bad. Maybe hell win because they dont like me, they dont like my personality. But I hate to say it, Im what you need. Im what you need. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. But if Biden ever did win, he would surrender your country to the mob. You know that. And he will have nothing to do with it. Its not him. I mean, hes being  Hes going to be pushed around. And shes, by the way, just so you know what youre going to get. Shes considered far more liberal than Bernie Sanders. How about that Thats what youre going to have. I dont think your state is into that. Unlike Biden, Ill always stand with the heroes of law enforcement. And Im deeply honored to have gotten all of those endorsements. That to me is a really big deal. That to me is really a big deal. And I just want to thank all of them, including the National Troopers Association and Coalition just came in. We also received the endorsement, total and complete endorsement from the Public Safety Alliance of Nevada, and the Las Vegas Police Protective Association from Nevada. And I want to thank for that, Steve Grammar, whos with us tonight. Wheres Steve Was Steve here Steve, thank you. Thank you. Thats a big deal. Make sure they get out and vote, Steve, because theyre playing around with the ballots. Okay You know your governor. So we had many sites, by the way, all exterior sites, all outside. Today, youll hear these phoneys back there. Well, look at that. Now today youre going to hear them. Theyll say, Oh, it was in  Well, the reason it was, we had five sites, all outside sites, like last night. Tremendous room. And a great gentleman who owns this building said, You know what What theyre doing is really unfair. You can use my building, Don. I want to thank you, Don. I want to thank you. This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, two agendas for the future. Joe Biden has spent the last 47 years selling out America. Look at what hes done. Everything hes done was wrong. He always voted the wrong way. Even his secretary of defense, his secretary of state, they said he always voted the wrong way. He was off shoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, depleting our military, and sacrificing your childrens future to China and other faraway lands. Ive spent the last four  He says  Only in Nevada can you have  I would never say it. What did you say Okay. This way I cant get in trouble. Ive spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to America, securing our borders, rebuilding our military, and standing up to China like no other president has ever done. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins the rioters and anarchists, and  Look, you see whats going on. The arsonists and flag burners. How about the flag burning I would love- I would love to have a law  This is so sad whats going on. When I see the American flag burn, I get so angry. I get so angry. I would love to have a law. It has to go through a big process. You burn the flag, you go to jail for one year. I would love to see it. I would love to see it. I would love to see it. I would love to see it. If I were a Congressman or Senator, Id be in there with that one. You know, theyll say, Oh, freedom of speech. Thats not freedom of speech. You burn the flag, you should go to jail for one year. I really mean that. Theyll say, Oh, its horrible. Hes against free speech. No, no, were not. Were not against free speech. But Im running for reelection to bring back the tremendous prosperity that we enjoyed before the plague came in, and its happening very fast. And Im running for your state. I love this state. You know, I put a lot of money in this state and its been a great investment. And we want to keep this state strong. Not for that reason, by the way, for other reasons, because this is a great place. You have a governor right now whos a political hack. We want to put violent criminals behind bars. And tell you governor to open up your state, by the way. Open up your state. You know, just so you know, these shutdowns, we did the right thing. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. They came in, they  We were all seeing what was happening. We closed up. I mean, you know, youre presiding over the greatest economy in history and a group of very smart people walk in and say, Sir, we have to close it. And we did the right thing. We closed it. Well, actually he didnt think we should close it yet. But later on, he said, We did the right thing. We closed it. We closed it. We saved millions of lives. If we wouldnt have closed it, we wouldve been talking two and a half or three million. Were at 180. Its far too much. But we would have been talking about  It wouldve been unacceptable, unsustainable. It wouldve been so bad. Think of it. Were at 180,000. Other countries are doing terribly. Did you see the statistics of us compared to other countries Us compared to Europe We have done an incredible job. We get absolutely no credit for the job weve done. And I dont want it myself, but I want it for the admirals and the generals and Mike Pence. And Joe Biden was against it. Remember He was totally against closing. He said, Oh, hes xenophobic. Im xenophobic I wanted it closed and nobody else did. At that time, nobody else did. I was way early. You know, they say, He didnt act fast. I was months early. Nancy Pelosi was a month and a half later saying, Come to Chinatown. Lets come to Chinatown. And Sleepy Joe was totally  He thought what I was doing was terrible. Then all of a sudden, now I see him saying, He should have closed it earlier. This guy  You know, the great thing about the age in which we live Its all down in tape. Its all down. I got a reel on him. We call it Bidens Best. You got to hear this. But we want to ensure the future of America, not the future of China and other countries, because if we win, America wins, and its all about America first. Youve had presidents, they never put America first. They didnt put America first. They didnt take care of our country, but were taking care of our country. Now, Joe Biden cannot lead our country because he really doesnt believe, truly, in our country. But I think thats a very strong statement. I dont think he has a clue. Ill be honest. The people that push him around dont believe in our country, because he agreed to a manifesto with crazy Bernie, right Its called the manifesto. You know why its called the manifesto Because this is beyond socialism. This is a word that starts with a C, not and S. Thats where theyre coming from. Thats where theyre coming from. At Bidens convention they decried America wicked. And they were saying its wicked sinful. Its destined for a fate of doom and despair. That was, by the way, that was the most depressing convention. We had a great convention. We had a great convention. They actually said that America wasnt great. They actually said that America was never great. You know who said that Cuomo, the governor of New York, said America wasnt great. I dont know if hes going to get away with that one. Thats going to haunt him. Thats going to haunt him. America wasnt great. Him and his brother, Fredo. You ever watch Fredo His ratings arent very good, so you probably dont. But we know the truth. Americas the most exceptional nation on Earth. And our destiny is blessed by God. We love this nation with all of our heart and soul, and we will always take care of our nation. You know, we have a little expression, Make America Great Again. Thats whats happened. And you know, we had it done. Now I say, Make America Great Again, Again. Comma. I go comma again. And thats what were doing at a record clip. Theyve never had a clip like this with the jobs and everything else. You see the numbers. On November 3rd, Nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, and were doing it. Were going to have a tremendous year next year. Or whether well allow Joe Biden and the group of handlers to impose a 4 trillion tax hike, ban American energy, destroy our suburbs, demolish our second amendment, and indoctrinate your children with a poisonous anti-American lie. Yeah. Get him out of here, would you please Under my leadership we built the greatest economy in the world. Hes going home to mom. And now were doing it again. Were developing a vaccine in record time. The other administration would have been years, and were almost there. Its going to be announced very soon. Well be ready before the end of the year. And we will very easily defeat the China virus. Thats whats happening. And were already making that turn. Were making that round beautiful last turn, but it should have never happened. China should have never let that happen. They should have stopped it in China. Under my administration, before the virus, we quickly achieved the lowest unemployment rate in Nevadas history. And well soon be there again. You see whats happening. A guy like Biden would totally eradicate Nevadas economy. He would make it impossible for you to compete. And hes already said if the doctor suggested, he would shut down the country again. Were not shutting down our country. A shutdown well destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of American. Look the Americans, you know, on the other side if you look at these shutdowns, and youre living through it right now. You know, there arent many states that are shut down. Theyre all Democrats. North Carolina, your state. But North Carolina, were not  You take a look at North Carolina. Pennsylvania shut down. Every one of them that are shut down are doing not well. Theyre not doing well. And they all have Democrat governors. And you know, when you look at the suicide rates, when you look at all of the suicide, all of the domestic violence, the drugs, all of the problems, we cant have it. We cant have it. Open up your state. You got to open up your state. Its all political. Its all political. Its all political. On November 4th, theyll announce, Were going to open up the states. Theyre only doing it to affect your November 3rd great election. Most important election. Biden will always do whatever the radical left demands. And if elected, his radical supporters wont just be causing mayhem on the streets. Theyll be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security. And by the way, the United States Supreme Court. And we will have a very different country. You know, the next president probably will have anywhere one, two, three, or four Supreme Court justices. If you want your second amendment, if you want life, if you want so many other things, even having to do with your military, even having to do with your vets, if you want things, if you want, youve got to have the court. Because theyll last for 25, 30, 40 years. Theyre put on as young people and they stay a long time. Our country will never be the same. Well never be able to recover from it. So you got to get out on November 3rd or early voting. You got to get out and vote. And you could send your ballot, and then you have to check that your ballots counted because they might not count your ballot in this state. They may not count your ballot. But were looking to save and were going to save America. Were not going to let that happen. So were joined tonight by two terrific congressional candidates that have been just incredible in the job theyve done. You see it. I mean, youve seen it all the way. The job theyve done in their campaign. They beat people that were very good, very talented, great politicians, and they won. Dan, where is he Dan Rodimer. Dan Rodimer. Dan Rodimer. And were with you all the way, Dan. And Jim Marchant. Jim, thank you very much. Thank you, Jim. So were backing you all the way. You got to get them in. We will take back the House. You know why Because people cannot stand Nancy Pelosi. They dont like Nancy Pelosi. Even the woman that owns the beauty parlor turned her in. Can you believe that Nancy Pelosis a customer. She turned her in. She thought it was disgraceful, but thats what were dealing with, a bunch of phonies. But you guys, we have your back 100%. Michael, youll make sure, all right I also want to introduce and thank  Hes done a fantastic job. Nevada Republican Party Chairman, Michael McDonald. And a friend of mine, and thank you, Michael. Your former Attorney General Adam Laxalt. And a person with tremendous spirit and personality to put it mildly. Shes tough, but shes very kind. Shes a great person, Kimberly Guilfoyle. Thank you, Kimberly. Thank you. Thank you, Kimberly. The owner of the Chicago Cubs and hes in first place, so hes very happy, the RNC Finance Chairman, Todd Ricketts. Where is Todd Todd, thank you. Great. Go win that pennant Todd. Win the pennant. One of the best people ever to work for me  One of the best people ever to work for me in government. Hes tough, hes smart, he can be vicious, but hes just fair more than anything else. But he is a talented guy with tremendous energy and tremendous brain power, Rick Grenell. Thank you, Rick. Thank you Don. Thank you Don. Also, a Las Vegas legend, Rick Harrison. Rick, thank you Rick. You are a legend, arent you, huh Great job youve done. Great job youve done. A friend of mine for a long time. Years ago, he was looking for a place. Can I tell this story just quickly, do you mind He was looking for a place and they said, Well, that sports never going to make it. Its too violent. They just dont know how violent the American people are, do they They never quite figured that out. No. They said, No, itll never make it. Theres nobody like this guy, Im telling you. I always say its a great sport. Without him, I dont know what theyd do. I dont know if anything would make it He could do anything. He is so smart, so tough, so cunning. Hes been a friend of mine for a long time, Ive been a friend of his, but I gave him a place a long time ago. And all I know is, just like we have outside, we had lines. I said, What the hell is going on here, Dana This place is packed. We were packed. We had thousands of people that couldnt get in, and I was so nice. I said, Lets do it again, Dana, please. And we did it again and again and again, and it became the UFC and he sold it and has a big chunk of it, but he got 4 billion when he sold it. 4 billion. Thats not too bad. Thats not too bad, Dana. But he really is, hes an incredible guy. And he also loves his fighters. He wants to take care of his fighters and he brought some of them along, the best. But I want to introduce Dana White. Dana, please stand up. And Dana brought along a few of his friends and these are not people you want to pick a fight with. Because under those beautiful suits, there are a lot of muscles, a lot of power, a lot of genius for fighting and for other things, but a lot of genius under those suits. A few members of the UFC community. Heres a man, he used to walk into that ring and he still does, and hes as good as there is in the world. Number one in the world. You dont want to pick a fight with him at a bar. Lets say youd had a fight and you happen to meet Colby Covington. You say, Whats your name And he said, My names Colby Covington. And the first time I saw Colby Covington, he walks into the ring. Now he wasnt fighting, but he walked in with that same hat that youre wearing. It said, Keep America great. It says, Make He doesnt care. As long as it has Trump on in someplace, he doesnt care. He doesnt discriminate. But this was the same day that we had our conservative reporter beat to hell by that wise guy, whos now in big trouble for doing what he did. And then he walks in wearing the hat, Keep America great. And he wears the hat and hes going like this because this was a big story. You remember what they did to that guy Conservative reporter, not a fighter. He wasnt a fighter. And it was 10 people against one. Now, if we had 10 people against that one, those 10 people would be in serious trouble. They said, What the hell But Id like to introduce Colby Covington. Great fighter. Great, great fighter. Incredible. He is a great fighter. Three months ago, I saw him fight a guy. He looked like it would be impossible to beat. I never saw muscles. He had muscles on muscles on muscles. And Colby is a very fit guy and fantastic. But he didnt look quite the same. It wasnt even a contest. It went a few rounds. I couldnt believe what you did. He took him apart so easily. It was like an easy day at the office. So you have to explain that to me someday, Colby, but we love you, man. Youre with us and where we are with you. Another great, great champion. Another great champion, Henry Cejudo, one of the best in the world. And Henry, please stand, please. Now, you won the championship twice, right Henry Twice. He won it twice. Dont mess with him. Dont mess with him. And his brother, Alonzo, is here. Alonzo Cruz. Thank you very much, Alonzo. Thank you. Thank you. And Alonzo doesnt mess with Henry, he learned that a long time ago. So one of the best fighters in the world, and hes got a tremendous fight coming up against, I guess the number one rated pound for pound fighter, Justin Gaethje. Please stand up, Justin. Justin Gaethje, thank you. And you feel good about that fight He said hes going to knock him out. Well, were going to be watching. Its right before the election, but I think Im going to be watching, okay Ill be watching, you better believe it. Thats going to be an incredible fight. Good luck. Good luck, Justin. Great fighter. And also Ali Abdelaziz, right Abdelaziz. Great guy. One of the best. Thank you very much. But these are great people that they have so many people at the UFC and theyve been big fans of us. They love our country. They love our country. And we loved them and nobody like our Dana. Thank you Dana, very much. Great honor. Thank you, man. Tonight, were also praying for everyone throughout the West affected by the devastating wildfires. We want really forest management, we want forest management My administration is closely coordinating with the state and local leaders, with the governor and we thank the more than 28,000 firefighters and first responders courageously braving the danger and their life, and Im going there tomorrow. Ill be going to California tomorrow. We have meetings with FEMA and all of the different people. Itll be amazing to see. Its like the biggest weve ever had. Its crazy. Its crazy whats going on. Thousands and thousands and thousands of acres. Its crazy. So were going to be there tomorrow. Well be with the governor. Were also going to various other places. Washington also is in big trouble and Oregon. I spoke with the governor of Oregon and theyve never had anything like it. And of course they also have a place called Portland and we will put that fire out. Just tell us to put it out, governor. That fire well put out. Thats a much easier fire to put out. It would take us less than a half an hour. Weve spent the last four years reversing the damage done by Joe Biden and all of the damage that him and his thought process has inflicted over a 47-year period. We passed record-setting tax cuts and record-setting regulation cuts. We achieved American energy independence. Nobody thought it was possible. When Biden pledged to abolish the production of American oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas, which is very clean, and he wanted to ban fracking, we said, No, were not doing that. For 47 years, Biden crushed the dreams of American workers to enrich foreign countries. Thats what happened. Look, he says hes going to change. Hes been there for 47 years and you know that hes been there until three and a half years ago. So its not like, Gee, he hasnt done it for 20. He was there recently. They didnt do it. And you dont change. And you always go back to the first statement. His first statement was anti- religion. His first statement was anti-fracking, anti-energy. His first statement was anti all of the things, but it was really anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment. He even put this whack job, he even put Beto ORourke, Beto. Great deal for us. Thats a great deal. By the way, our stock market is setting records, I hate to say, in the middle a pandemic. But hopefully, as we round that final turn on the pandemic, were setting records with the stock market. Your 401ks are doing very well. Your stocks are doing very well. And you know what If something would happen where hed get in, and theres a headwind, believe it or not, that stock market would be much higher, but theres a headwind on the possibility, okay Everything is a possibility. Theres a headwind. But Ill tell you what, if he ever got in, you would have a market crash the likes of which this country has never seen before. Just remember it, just to remember it, because what they want to do is crazy, the Green New Deal, 100 trillion, the Green New Deal. Thats more money than we could make in a thousand years, a hundred trillion dollars. We dont like that building. The windows are too big. What do you do Rip it down and build a new one. All good. That sounds good. I saved the U.S. auto industry by withdrawing from the last administrations job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And were building many auto plants, you know that, some here, but were building many auto plants in Michigan, many auto plants in Michigan. If we dont win Michigan after all those auto plants, and I dont know, but its been tough but we won it last time. And were showing a poll that just came out that were two points up in Michigan. Thats very good, thats very good. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to Chinas rapid theft of American jobs. Bidens agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. Thats what it is. For the last four years, Ive been delivering for our incredible Hispanic community, Im fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods, low taxes, low regulations on all Hispanic-owned small business, and they are great business people. And they understood that. They understood that, they understood it And by the way, theres nobody that knows our Southern border better than, I call them the Hispanics, I call them the Latino. I said, What do you prefer Its very interesting. Some say, Call us Latino. Others say, Call us Hispanic. Others say, Call us whatever the hell you want. We love you, we love you. But our Hispanic population knows our Southern border better than anybody else. And they dont want criminals coming across. They want people to come across, but they want them to come across legally. And we have the strongest Southern border now that weve ever had. The Democrats and Biden would be a disaster for Hispanic Americans. Hes pledged to wage attacks on Catholic organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor. Theyre fighting him. He supports taxpayer-funded extreme late-term abortion. Extreme late-term. He would allow left-wing anarchies to burn down your businesses. He would hand over your jobs to China, and your country to the socialists and beyond the socialists. The Democrat Party also continues to attack our incredible border agents, more than half of whom happen to be Hispanic Americans. And theyre great. And I want to thank not only law enforcement, but a big part of law enforcement, the Border Patrol and the ICE agents, theyre incredible. The ICE agents, Dana could sign some of them up, the ICE agents, they go into like a pack. They go at a pack. They go into a pack of MS-13 fighters. These are criminals and they do it like its routine. You dont want that job. I dont see any of the people, male or female sitting in this audience, that wants that job, ICE. They take out thousands and thousands of MS-13 killers a year and bring them the hell back out of our country. All around our country, our communities are protected by Hispanic American heroes in law enforcement, and they deserve unwavering gratitude. I want to just thank you all, I want to thank you all. With us tonight are members of the National Border Patrol Council and they are great friends of us. I want to just thank them. The official union of our nations incredible border patrol agents. And you know what Theyre not supposed to do it, but they did it anyway, they endorsed me. I want to thank Brandon Judd, whos here, and Art Del Cueto. Art. Wheres Brandon, where is my Brandon Where is Brandon Look at these guys. Look, theyre ready. Theyre ready to fight. Hey Brandon, Art, pick out your toughest guy, I want to see whether or not he can take Colby in a fight. Dont do it. Thank you very much. Thanks fellas. We appreciate it very much. Thanks. Great job too. Great job. My administration has achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended catch and release. We stopped asylum fraud. Weve deported 20,000 gang members and over half a million criminal aliens. We built over 320 miles, as of today, border wall and were adding 10 new miles every single week. Were doing about 10 miles a week and well be finished with the wall very shortly. And you think, That was an easy one. That was not an easy one. We were fought. Two things, and I say it, two things that never get old. Remember the Democrats are saying, A wall wont work. Really Tell me about it. Wall works. Thats one of the reasons our numbers are so good, but two things that will never get old-  one of the reasons our numbers are so good, but two things that will never get old, never, you know what they are A wall and a wheel. A wall and a wheel. Itll never get old. A wall. I see so many things and I see all these businesses, computers, you come up with a new chip, you come up with a new computer, you come up with a new laptop. Three weeks later, you buy it, three weeks later, its obsolete. But a wall will never be obsolete, and a wheel will never be obsolete. You come back in a thousand years, a wall and a wheel. Thanks to our powerful new security measures, weve doubled the amount of meth seized at the border over the last year, weve doubled. We invested 2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in 75 years, the Space Force. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. And Ive accomplished more in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years. Thats true. Thats true. I withdrew from the last administrations disastrous Iran nuclear deal. So good for Israel. So good that we did that. They paid 150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash. I think Dana White could have made a slightly better deal than that. You know what we got for it Nothing. We got nothing. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS. al-Baghdadi we eliminated the number one terrorist in the world. And were talking over a 50 year period. Number one in the world, the mass murder of American troops and many other people throughout the world, Qasem Soleimani is dead. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and weve achieved the two historic peace deals in the Middle East in just the last month, two, two. Over 75 years, they did two. We did two in a month. And many other countries are coming in, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have both agreed to normalize relations with Israel. Nobody thought this was possible. In fact, you didnt hear it because they dont report this. They just dont want to report it, but they nominated your President twice last week on two different subjects for a Nobel Prize. But the fake news media didnt cover it, so thats it. Biden got it. Remember Well, okay. Remember when our great President, right Barack Hussein Obama, he got it. Right Like immediately. And they said, Why did you get it And he was unable to explain, do you remember Why did you get it Because it was like, he just became President, and they said, Were going to nominate Barack Hussein Obama for the Nobel Peace award, right And what happened And then Biden said, What about me They said, Who the hell is he This guy, what the hell has he done But its true. Obama got it for no reason whatsoever. Rick, you know that No reason whatsoever. Joe Biden brought you only endless wars, Im bringing you peace and Im bringing our troops back home. Theyre all coming back. Endless wars. Biden voted for the Iraq war. He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world. When I banned China from coming in, highly infected, he said it was hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died just by that one move alone. When the- Thank you. I agree, actually, but I dont think Im allowed to say it. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II, were delivering life-saving therapies, weve achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country, anywhere in the world. You dont hear this. Europes excess mortality rate is 24% higher than the US, and despite their very punitive lockdowns, theyre once again, seeing very large spikes in cases, unfortunately. The United States has experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation and the fastest recovery by far. Whos going to do well And theres a reason for it. Through our historic relief programs, weve saved more than half a million Nevada jobs and over 42,000 Nevada businesses, weve saved 42,000 of your businesses. And hes looking at doing all of this stuff. He will destroy protections for preexisting conditions and decimate your 401s, your retirement system, your stocks, hell establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal illegal aliens. He wants to cut your vet facilities in half, go to socialized healthcare and end 180 million Americans private healthcare plans, which they love. Biden pledges to oppose school choice, and he stated that if elected, charter schools are gone. And charter schools have been great. In a second term, Ill provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, a limitless future for all Americans. Its really a vote for the American dream. Thats what it is. Its the American dream versus the American nightmare. Instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that weve been through, we are changing Washington. So in concluding, this wonderful afternoon, and again, Don, thank you very much, but in concluding, this wonderful afternoon, and if the governor comes after you, which he shouldnt be doing, Ill be with you all the way. Ill be with you all the way. Dont worry about a thing. Over the next four years, well be making America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and well end our reliance on China once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring economies, and record prosperity. We will expand Opportunity Zones, and we will continue cutting taxes and regulations at a level that nobody has ever seen before. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities. And well be watching the ballots very closely also, by the way. And we will ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not in enforcing their own agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of these endless ridiculous foreign wars, all coming back. We will maintain Americas unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength, two and a half trillion dollars, have the strongest military weve ever had, beautiful brand new equipment. When I took it over, it was totally depleted, our military. We have the greatest equipment that any military has ever even conceived of, things that people have no idea what we have, and lets keep it that way. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency already signed, further reduce health insurance premiums, and the cost of prescription drugs will be dropping like a rock very soon. The drug companies do not like me too much. Its a favored nations clause I signed. We will strongly protect Medicare, and your Social Security will be totally secure. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. When I took over, NASA was a shell of itself. It was closed, they had grass growing in the runways, grass growing in the runways. Now its the number one space center in the world by far. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust, and were going to keep it that way. For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for your state, Nevada. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and on November 3rd or sooner, get out and vote. From Carson City to Elko, from Las Vegas to Reno, from Minden to right here in Henderson, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our great freedom. Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys, innovators and trailblazers who tamed the frontier, raised up the mighty Hoover Dam, transformed a sprawling desert into a shining oasis and inspired the world with the brilliant lights of the Vegas Strip. Our American ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth, and we are going to make it greater than ever before. Thats what were doing. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are, you know the story, going to keep on working, going to keep on fighting, and going to, like these guys, keep on winning, winning, winning. You hear that, Colby You hear that, Justin Okay Hes fighting a tough customer, but I dont know. I think maybe, Im in Vegas, Ill have to place Is the President allowed to place a bet I dont know. Theyll say, The President of the United States just placed two bets, Justin and Colby. I dont know. I dont know, but they are great. Thatd be easy money. Well, maybe not that easy. I dont know if its that easy. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Nevada, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you."
Mosinee,Sep17,2020,"Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you very much. That is a beautiful site right behind me, isnt it Thats a beautiful site. Thank you very much. And a very big hello, Wisconsin, weve been very good together. And Im thrilled to be with thousands of loyal, hard-working American patriots. 47 days from now, were going to win Wisconsin and were going to win four more years in the White House. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I feel that way so strongly, so do you. Joe Biden devoted his entire career to offshoring Wisconsin jobs, outsourcing your factories, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless ridiculous foreign wars and surrendering your childrens future to China. You know what hes been doing I just see hes up there tonight getting softball questions from Anderson Cooper. They dont ask me questions like that. And the audience isnt quite like this. Do you see what his audience  theyve got cars. They have car in a parking, its the weirdest thing Ive ever seen. And CNN is going, Oh, this is so beautiful. Its not beautiful. They have cars in a parking lot. What a deal, Ill tell you, what a deal. Bidens supported every disasterous global sellout for half a century, including a NAFTA, China. You take a look at Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization and TPP. He supported them all, Biden, surrendered your jobs to China and you know that. I probably wouldnt be here if it werent for that, it was one of the big things, one of the big reasons I decided to say to my great wife, our first lady, lets go have some fun. Lets go have some fun. Shes done a great job and very popular. And the family is all over the place, all over the country. But unlike Joe, who lets you down when hed never even came back to Milwaukee to apologize or just to pay respects, I came to Wisconsin and Ive been here a lot since, since we started this, a lot. And youve been a tremendous beneficiary of what Ive done and I have to, because youve been with me, youve supported me and weve had great victories together, all victories, so I want to thank you. Now Biden wants to surrender our country to the violent left-wing mob. You see whats happening. If Biden wins very simple, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins, the rioters, anarchists, arsonists, and flag burners, they win and were not into flag burners. We dont like flag burners. Id like to say, pass a law, one year in jail, you started burning flags, we put you in jail for a year. We should do that. They would have done that, its a different world, I guess, but its sort of coming back to the way we have to have it because were for law and order. They say, dont use that term, its too tough. No, everybody wants law and order. Minorities want law and order. Everybody wants law and order. They have to have it. Im running for the reelection and a very important reelection to bring jobs in factories back and thats a continuation. Because I dont know if you know it, the single greatest year Wisconsin has ever had was last year. The second best year that Wisconsin has ever had was the year before. And guess what the third was the year before that And youre going to have your best year economically next year, its all heading in that direction despite the pandemic given to us by China. We want to put the violent criminals behind bars and we have to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China, not to other very terrible forces out there, because if we win, very simply America wins. And thats what we want, we want this great country to win. Over the last three and a half years, weve secured Americas borders. Fixed the disastrous trade deals, they have been the worst ever. Not even  it was not even  when I looked at these, I studied them and I used to talk about them, they had to be bad. When I started studying, I said, Who are the people that made these deals2 Grossly incompetent people. Brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt the awesome power of the U.S. military and obliterated the ISIS caliphate. We open obliterated it. Obama was not able to do it, he wasnt able to come close. It was just announced that in 2019, before the virus came in from China, we grew median income by a record of 4,400 in just one year, achieving the highest median income in U.S. history. Thats in the history of our country. In the first three years, we lifted six point six million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any president in the history of our country. Thats not bad. And I didnt even make these numbers up. These are numbers that  they sound good to me. We built the greatest economy in the history of a world. This is the greatest economy in the history of the world. And then the virus came in, we closed it down, we saved millions and millions of lives. Wed be at two and a half million, two million, three million. A number that would not be sustainable, would not be acceptable. A horrible number, there shouldnt have been one person that died. It should have been stopped at China. They stopped it for their country, but it came out to us, to Europe, to the rest of the world, 188 countries. We will deliver a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year. And it could be very, very soon. Youve been seeing whats going  could be very, very soon. Could be, its amazing how all of a sudden they hate the vaccine. When they thought it couldnt be done, they said, Well, hes got to get a vaccine. And then all of a sudden, theyre looking like its going to be very close. Were doing great. Were doing great with vaccines and therapeutics, Remdesivir, all sorts of other things that are bringing the rates down, like at numbers that nobody can believe. But we have three vaccines right now, theyre in the final stage, clinical trials. We worked it for the FDA where they approved it fast. They went very fast, very quick, at levels that nobody else could have ever achieved. No other administration, certainly the last one, because the last one was grossly incompetent. In fact, thats why Im here, because if it was good, I wouldnt have run. If they did their job, I wouldnt have run. I was very happy in my other life. I was very happy, but Im very happy in this life. More happy, because nobody has produced in three and a half years, the first three and a half years, nobody has done what we have been able to do, nobody. So well defeat the virus and next year will be truly, I think, from an economic standpoint and from other standpoints, maybe the best year of all. Hard to believe were going so fast, the numbers have been incredible. Weve had employment numbers, the best ever. Weve had retail sales numbers the best ever. You see them all, they come out every day. And our stock market is for the most part, at a new high. And if people have 401ks, if you want to have your 401k go down like to depression levels, I think you should vote for sleepy Joe, because hes going to raise your interest. Hell be raising your interest rates. I watch him though, hes denying all this up. Everything that he said, hes now denying. He said, no fracking, right There will be no fracking during the  he didnt know what fracking was, but he said theres no fracking. The reason is because everybody else, all of the radical left candidates up there, they couldnt get too far left, so Joe agreed. Then he gets the nomination, now theyre all angry. You know that crazy Bernie, all of the left democrats, they dont want to vote for him anymore because he made promises and now all of a sudden he forgot that he said no fracking. He said, Well, now we can do some fracking. But remember this in politics, its always the thing that they say first, thats what theyre going to do. No guns, no religion, no energy, no oil, remember that. Remember, he put Beto in charge of his gun policy, right Beto, crazy Beto. Remember when Beto went out, he said, I was born for this. And thats when it all came down. As soon as I heard that, anybody said they were born for this, that doesnt play well. But hes in charge of the Second Amendment. And you wont have a Second Amendment. Frankly, you wouldnt have a Second Amendment if I didnt get elected, it would have been obliterated. It would have been torn up. Maybe it would have been totally knocked out. But theres tremendous pressure on your Second Amendment. As long as Im here, youll always have a Second Amendment. But I want to just say, they do disinformation, they make up a phony story and then they go with it. They make up a totally phony story. Its called disinformation. And one of the things, oh, what they did, the worst of all was the soldiers. Because, nobody loves our soldiers like I do and they made up a phony deal. And thats why I say the gloves are off because when they do that, thats worse than what Im going to talk to you about, thats big 10. You know we got it back, right We got big 10. But the soldier story, about standing over their graves, you know the one Im talking about, then they do a commercial. And I said, the good news about that is the gloves are off. I can now call him grossly incompetent, the man is incompetent. Hes been there for 47 years, he didnt do a thing. Now all of a sudden, in years where he was never considered smart, but now hes really not considered smart. And now all of a sudden hes going to do what he never did in 47 years. Hes got to do this and that and everything that Im doing, everything that were doing. But I want to congratulate the big 10 conference on yesterdays announcement that the fall season will start very soon. Oh, I hope your team does well after all that. I hope that team does well. But I especially want to thank a football legend, he was great. Wisconsins own Barry Alvarez, he was great. Good, got to be careful when you do that, a lot of times you dont like people too much. They say, Oh, but hes a good man. We worked with him. We worked with a whole group, including the commissioner of the league, did a very, very good job, did a very good job. But we called them, and the reason is that they took an ad. In other words, another one, disinformation. They took an ad saying I was against football. Im the one that said they shouldnt close. But I said that, if they close, they close. But then they took an ad saying Im the one, I didnt want it. I wanted it closed. So then I said, Well, no, I dont. I want it open. Let me call up the commissioner. We called up the commissioner and he was great. He said, You really think so And bottom line, we worked very hard, lots of calls to lots of different states, lots of people. We dealt with the players, the parents of the players, who are really the boss, thats okay, I wont say that. But these are players that have a shot at the NFL. They have a shot at pro-football. We want the NFL to proudly stand when they sing our National Anthem. Or their ratings are going to continue to go down like they did last weekend, down 27%. Because people dont want that. You know what, we have enough politics, right We have politics here. We have politics all over. In fact, sometimes I have to turn it off. I cant do it anymore. I cant watch me. Its always  I cant watch me. I cant watch. But no, we have enough politics. We dont want to watch now on Sunday, all, here we go again with the politics, let them play football, let them stand and salute or put your hand on your heart and be proud of our country and be proud of our great American flag. And then go home to the mansion and have a good time. Take a nice sauna and then if you want, after you recover, you come out and you go and you do your thing, whatever the thing may be. But people dont want to see it and the ratings are down. Here we go again. I thought we taught them that lesson two years ago. Didnt we think I thought we taught that lesson. But Biden would absolutely eradicate your states economy. I know this state very well. Its one of the reasons I made the great deal with Canada and Mexico, but Canada, because they were taking advantage of you so badly on your dairy products. You had a 287% tariff on your dairy products with Canada. People dont realize Canada is one of the toughest negotiators and they treated your state and this country very unfairly until I came along, very, very unfairly. Did you know that 287. But I saw some farmers and this was like the straw that broke the camels back. They had something called specialty milk. Does anybody know what that is Right, you know. A lot of people  its a small little grouping of milks, specialty milk. But this was the final straw. And I met some people and Canada finally did it to them like they did it to everybody else. And they raised a tariffs massively, they made it impossible. They tried to take over that business too, along with all of them, it was just massive and horrible what they did. And that really got me going, the little specialty milk, specialty products, a small portion, but you know what, that was it. And we have a great deal. The USMCA is a great deal and Im very honored to have done it. But it was all because of specialty milk and the way you were taken advantage of by Canada. You know, they have the wonderful, Oh, Canada, we love to hear the song, right But let me tell you, they are very tough. And theyve taken advantage of our country for many, many years. And I will tell you this, theyre not so happy now, but at least they got a deal, but youre happy. And its about time you were happy. You now have a great deal and youre not going to have your companies leaving for Mexico anymore or Canada. And youre not going to have them make your product in Mexico or Canada, send it over here with no tariff, with no tax. Where we lose tax, we lose jobs, we lose our companies, we lose everything. And they make a lot of money selling the product to us, same product. So were not doing that stuff anymore. Theres a tremendous disincentive, its called, like, lets not do it. And you havent seen that lately. You havent seen too many companies leaving have you Its sort of an amazing thing. Its a little bit like what we did with the statues. So on the statutes, they were knocking them down three or four months ago. I said, Do we have any laws No, but there was a very old law. I said, What was it You get 10 years in jail, 10 years in prison, they actually use the word prison, which is a tough word. You get 10 years in prison if you knocked down a statue or a monument. I said, Let me see that law, I want to see that law. Right, Glen, right I want to see that law. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. So big tax cuts, big regulation cuts. The Democrats, they want to  the Democrats, they want to just really break us down in terms of our competitive ability to compete with other nations. Do you notice whats happening with Japan You notice whats  We have taken billions and billions of dollars in from China. We charge them a fortune. In fact, many farmers in this group, because you got to love Trump. I gave you 28 billion, right Thank you very much, China, right You were targeted. 12 billion, Sonny Purdue, Secretary of Agriculture. I said, Sonny, how much have they been hit for, targeted for Remember when China said were not going to do anything, were not buying. They thought they were going to put pressure on us. Sonny said, Sir, 12 billion, the year before last and last year was 16, total of 28 billion. We took 28 billion out of the tariffs. China never paid us 25 cents, not 25 cents with Obama and Biden. And in all fairness with no president, they paid us nothing. They pay us now tens of billions of dollars. I took a small portion of it, I added it up, 16 and 12, 28, and I said, 28 billion is going to the farmers. Did everybody get that money, right You had a very good year, the farmers have had a very good year. Last week, China ordered and you have to understand, I view China differently now than I did six months ago, we made a great trade deal but I view it differently because I dont know if I can ever view it the same. But last week they know how I feel and theyre very smart. So instead of saying, were not going to do business, which would have been okay with me. We would have worked it out somehow, you would have been very successful, the farmers. But last week, they had the largest order of corn. Did you know this In the history of our country. Did anyone know this, the farmers From China, thank you very much. The largest order of soybeans in the history of our country. And one of the largest cattle orders in the history of our country, because theyre very smart. Somebody else would have said, well, lets not do business. And then it would have been easy for me, but they gave us so much. I have every farmer calling up saying, please do me a favor. We love this. We love this. This is a great deal. Its a great deal, but we feel differently about it, dont we We just feel differently about it. I dont talk about it like I used to, I talked about it, it was great. And it turned out to be a great deal, but I dont talk about it the same way. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas for the future than these two parties, you got law and order on one side and you have chaos on the other. On November 3rd, Wisconsin will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we will allow Biden and the Democrats to impose a four trillion dollar tax hike, ban American energy, confiscate your guns, which is what they want to do. Shut down the economy, destroy the suburbs. You know they were destroying our suburbs, you know that, right I dont know, if somebody said, you just doing okay in the suburbs I said, How can I do okay, I saved the suburbs. What Ive done is saved the suburbs. And you know this, I dont have to go into it, but I saved the suburbs. I think the suburbs  Last time, four years ago, Oh, hes not going to do well with women. I did great with women. They said, Well a big thing. Remember that. No, but was that one of the greatest evenings ever, remember And remember all the fake news, look at all the  Oh la, thats a lot. Thats a lot of people back there. Look at that, the red lights are on. Dont worry, I wont say anything bad about you CNN. Because as soon as I see, as soon as I- Because as soon as I see  As soon as Im getting ready to say something about fake news, et cetera, et cetera, the lights start going off so Im not going to  One just went off I think. You can tell by the lights, they got that little beautiful red light. You see it But I wont say anything bad about them but they are fakers and do you remember when they  Remember when they were saying that the polls are terrible. Actually these polls are very good compared  That was so bad it was like why did anybody vote. Theyre called suppression polls. They make them so bad that you lose all your appetite, you lose all your spirit, they take your guts out, and you dont go and vote, and your wife looks at you and says, Darling I love that guy, but hes not going to win. He doesnt have a chance because the polls, hes down 10, hes down 20, hes down 50 points, darling. He cant possibly win. Lets go have dinner and then well come home and watch his concession speech. But my people didnt buy that because my people went out to vote. Instead, we watched her concession speech. Crooked Hillary, that was a real piece of work. Remember when she was saying, Will you accept the decision of the voters Will you accept that decision I wasnt perfect, I said Ill see how it works out. I should have said, Yes, I will, but I couldnt do that because I know how crooked she is. Would you accept the decision The anchor said to me like, Will you accept Theyre coming after me, I said, Youre supposed to be going after her a little bit too. Did you ever see debates where you had all of the anchors plus the candidates against me Here we sit, is that Air Force One, yes, thats Air Force One. How did that happen A lot of the times Id say to the anchor, Id say, Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This isnt fair. I mean Im watching what theyre doing with Biden where hes using teleprompters, Move it up, move it up, I cant see, I cant see. Hes shot. Hes shot. President Xi of China is not shot. Putin is not shot. Kim Jong-un, remember were supposed to be in a war with him, what happened to the war No, it seems to be good. Did you see the Middle East two days ago Remember our incompetent negotiator John Kerry He never got up to walk. The guys getting beaten on every point, I say, Walk. Walk. Get up and leave the table. Youre giving up. Theyd say, We want this. Hed say, Well, Id rather not. We want this. Okay, you got it. We want that. You got it. We want that. Say no and walk. Theyll probably possibly call you back and if they dont thats okay too. But right now I will tell you Iran, if we win, Iran will be calling us within the first week, theyre dying to make a deal. GDP down 27%. They dont have too much money for terror anymore, its actually amazing, do you notice whats going on Now I dont want to speak too loud, but I did put out on social media the other day that if they hit us in any way, any form, written instructions already done, were going to hit them 1000 times harder than weve ever hit them before. So hopefully they will just come and well make a deal and theyll go back to being a rich country, let them go back and be rich but they cannot have a nuclear weapon. They cannot. That deal was so bad that Obama made. 150 billion, they got 150 billion for nothing. You know the deal is practically  If I didnt terminate it which Im proud to have done, but if I didnt terminate it, they got 1.8 billion in cash, how about that If I didnt terminate that stupid deal, first of all you wouldnt have the deal in the Middle East and all these countries are joining, its happening fast. They want to all join. We did it, you know, the reverse. We did it the  Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You know its interesting, thank you very much. I knew I like you. So the Nobel Peace Prize. So the funny thing, a lot of people dont know because the fake news doesnt write about it. So if youre a president, right And you are nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, youre the United States, no, but think of this. Thats a big deal. I mean Obama got it like in his first couple of weeks and nobody knew why he got it including him, remember He couldnt tell you why. He had no idea. To this day, he has no idea why he got it. But if youre a president and you get nominated, then two days later, you get nominated, did you know this, a second time, for a different deal. Kosovo. Serbia. Theyve been killing each other for hundreds of years. I stopped a lot of death and I did it like easy, it wasnt hard for me. Its sort of a natural thing to do but we did a good thing. But you know what They did a check. So I got nominated twice for the Nobel Peace Prize, thats a big deal, I dont know. I should have gotten nominated seven times because we did a lot of other things, but these are for two different deals, and not one mention was made on the evening news. Think of it. I got rid of the prosecutor, heres the billion, right But they dont want to play that too often. You have to look around for it. Its a very unfair deal but as the expression goes, we won, I dont know how the hell we did it. When you look at the opposition, when you look at how unfair it is and these guys know very well, you look at how unfair it is, its pretty damn good, but we have a lot of support. We have tremendous support of the people. These rallies, look at this rally. These rallies  These rallies are incredible gap ever polled. Im not a believer in the polls but I believe that one. Its the biggest enthusiasm gap, hes got no enthusiasm. The only enthusiasm is for the people that want to beat us, they want to beat me. Thats the only thing hes got, the people that want to  They couldnt care less about him. He could be that piece of wood that was left in the ground. Biden will hand the left wing mob the keys to your kids classroom. Earlier today I took a historic stand against the hateful lies being fed to Americas youth, the parents know all about it. I checked, theyre doing it in Wisconsin too. I was a little surprised, Im a little surprised. Im a little surprised you let it happen actually but were going to get rid of it. I announced that were launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. Were going to teach our children the truth about America, that were the most exceptional nation ever to exist and were getting better every single day. Sleepy Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the far left. He even opposed sending the National Guard into a place called Kenosha, did you ever hear of Kenosha How about that, did we do a good job I wish we did it a little sooner but we finally got your governors okay. We have to do that if  We got to get the governors to say please do it. How they dont do it, how they dont do it in some other places when you look at whats going on with Chicago, right When you look at whats going on with Portland, those are just anarchists. You know how long it would take us to fix up Portland in terms of ending it all Id say far less than an hour, Id say a half hour. Look what we did at Minneapolis. Were doing well in Minnesota because they saw what happened. Now they shouldnt have allowed it to go on for 11 days, they should have called us immediately but do you remember that beautiful night Nice evening, a little problem, there were a lot of buildings in the background that were burning down to the ground as reporters said, No, this is a peaceful protest. I dont know if its your state but a couple of them they have  Youre allowed to protest, so you cant go to church but you can rip the hell out of the streets, of Main Street, of 5th Avenue, break up the stores. Burn down the buildings. Climb over each others face, you can climb right over their face. You dont have to wear masks, you dont have to do anything. 25,000 people walking down the street, looters, anarchists, agitators, burning down stores, throwing things at police. Theyve taken the authority away from our police, our great police. Theyve taken their authority and their dignity away. Were giving it back, we have to, we have to. By the way, I was endorsed by New Yorks finest and were with them all the way. I was just endorsed two days ago by Chicago Police. I think that takes courage, right Philadelphia, Florida, Texas, everybody, Ohio. I dont know, did anybody  Is there one group of  Even if it was a tiny little group of two or three police, did anybody endorse Sleepy Joe I dont think so. But we did a great job in Kenosha. We got out there, I went there as you know, a little while ago but had we not gone in that place would  It would have been burned to the ground. They did damage, we should have gone in. I wanted to go in the first night, we would have stopped it immediately but it was a great outcome as was in Minnesota. Again, if they would have called us early it would have been over. Portland, Id love to go there. That would be so easy. You know in Seattle, they heard we were coming in, they gave up. They heard we  I said, Thats enough. Were going in. I dont care. Were going in. Do you have permission. No, were going in. They took over a chunk of the city, and when they heard we were going in its like, Well we give up, thats it. That was the end of the Settle problem. Its a terrible thing thats going on. All in Democratic run, super liberal run, cities. The red cities are doing great. I think were doing great all over, the Republican cities, were fair. Were not stupid. How stupid these people are. Did you see Chicago 48 people shot, six died. You know were in Afghanistan, were pulling the troops, you know that, were coming back, were almost finished. Were pulling  Finally, these endless wars. These endless wars, and we had to fight other things but weve done a great job but were acting like a police force over there. No, were pulling the troops, were almost out of Iraq. Thats another one, were down to about 2,000 troops, did you know that Sean 2,000 troops. So Syria, were out but we kept the oil so we have some  Was it okay that we at least kept the oil I feel badly because we have some troops  Well you havent pulled the troops. No no, were gone, we pulled all the troops out of Syria. Remember we were supposed to be guarding the border between Syria and Turkey I said, Why are we doing that They said, Well, we are. I said, Wait a minute, we have an army of 100,000 here, an army of 25,000, 30,000 here. We got 5,000 soldiers. Thats a very dangerous position to be in. I dont like it. Theyve been guarding their own borders with different names for a thousand years. Why the hell do we have to be over there guarding their border We want to guard our own borders, right, where were doing very well. Where were doing very well. Were doing great on our southern border, I hate to say this, but that wall is going up very rapidly, 10 miles a week. Were up to 330 miles and the wall will be finished very soon. You think that was easy, that was not easy, our great congressman over here, that was not easy. The Democrats were totally in favor of the wall until I said when I came in, We will build the wall. As soon as I said it, they were against the wall. They said, We dont want you to build the wall. Walls dont work. I said, No no, walls always work. You know what else works The wheel. The wheel and the wall, you can go back. Come back in 1,000 years from now. The only two things I know for sure, youre going to have a wheel and youre going to have a wall. The computers, they come up with a brand new computer, its genius, 12 days later, its obsolete. But walls are never obsolete, neither are wheels. So I made one mistake and I tell this to these guys because they were great warriors for me, the congressmen. They were incredible actually. I tell it to them. I should have said instead of we will build the wall, we will build the wall, we will build  Then the Democrats held us up and fought us and sued us and everything else and now we won so many lawsuits on the wall and we had the military money, I can build like 10 walls with all the money we have. Its the craziest thing. Maybe well build it double thick or well go twice as high. No, but the wall is great. Everything, everything, that they wanted, but I made one mistake. I should have said, We will not build a wall. Then they would have insisted that we build it, I could have saved two years of litigation. We will not build a wall under any circumstances. Then Pelosi would say, We demand that you build a wall. These people are terrible. Crazy Nancy, crazy as a bedbug. Shes crazy as a bedbug. She decided to make a nice little stop-in at the beauty parlor, how did that work out Not too good, it didnt work out too well. Can you imagine The owner of the beauty parlor is a MAGA lady, she loves Trump. Can you believe it I dont know what it is but I think if I owned a beauty parlor, I had a customer, Im not sure Id be turning her in. The owner turned Nancy in. Thats a lot of hate. Thats serious hate, right No, shes a great owner. As far as Im concerned, I think shes fantastic. Shes for us. They said, What made you do it You know what she said, Because I see how hard our president has to work. I see what they put him through. I see what he puts with and I turned her in. How about that How about that We love her. She can do my hair anytime. I think Im going to call her in. Check it out, maybe you can do something. Maybe you can improve it, its not bad though. I have friends that  I have friends my age, theyre not looking too good. Instead of standing up for America, Joe Biden and the Democrats, they condemn America and war is always waged on our great law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. Kamala Harris, thats another great beauty, Kamala Harris, thats a beauty. Remember, I tell this story all the time. When you pick somebody, you pick somebody thats hot, thats going in the right direction, right She came out, she was at like 14, 15 in the polls, and she started going down, down, down, it never stopped. It drove her crazy. She was terrible at the debates. Wait till you see what  I dont want to put pressure on him but wait till you see what Mike Pence does to her in the debates, but I dont want to put  I dont want to put pressure on Mike. Do we have a great vice president Is he good Hes great, and he loves this state. Loves all the states actually. Hes just a great American but do you remember his last debate What he did to that character from Virginia That one wasnt good. The other guys jumping around, Mike is just sitting there, we love America, were going to lower your taxes. Thank you, you win. No, Mike is great. But Kamala Harris and 13 members of Bidens staff urged their supporters to donate to a fund to bail out rioters, take them out of jail, get them out of jail as soon as possible. Including one who attempted to murder a police officer, a man who was accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl. This is what were dealing with. This is what were dealing with. You know Kamala was considered, is considered further left than Crazy Bernie, think of that. They got there  I mean seriously, watch. You know the manifesto that Biden and  Its not Biden, Biden has not agreed to anything. His people, his representatives, because Biden doesnt know hes alive, lets not kid ourselves. Biden. Biden didnt agree, he didnt, they just told him whats happening. They said, Listen, youre against fracking but now you have to be in favor of fracking because you lucked out. Elizabeth Warren decided not to drop out and when she stayed, Pocahontas, you know Pocahontas Did anybody ever hear of her Shes another great one. Pocahontas. I said to her a long time ago, Ive got more Indian blood in me than you do and I have none, I have none. Sadly. Id love a little bit of it, but I have none, I said  I turned out to be right. She choked and she went for a blood test. Remember Was it 1024th Meaning maybe nine hundred years ago, there was a little action going on. Crazy Pocahontas, shes a nasty one though, isnt she Shes a terrible person. I was hoping that shed win so we could go after her because I think Kamala is not as smart but shes a little bit less vicious. I think this. The one who treated Sleepy Joe the worst was Kamala. She accused him of MeToo, she accused him of everything. She accused him of  That he was a racist, right That he was a racist Because what hes done to the black population of this country was a terrible thing. Shes accused him of everything under the book, the busing, remember, the busing scandal. So I said brilliantly hell never pick her because she was too terrible to him. She was the worst of everybody. By far, I would say, but she picked him and hopefully thats going to be history, its not going to matter, and that is no way for a woman to become the first president, thats for sure. If a woman is going to become the first president of the United States, it cant be her. That would rip our country apart. This is not what people want and she comes in through the backdoor, this would not be what people want, especially because its her. Biden has called to end cash bail, you know that right, for vicious criminals Meaning if you assault a copy or anybody else, youre right back on the street the next day. He called for police and he calls them all the time the enemy. He says theyre the enemy and he just thinks its terrible. He think its terrible. Now hes liking the police much more. Its a little late. Remember, first instinct, thats where theyre going, and he has no choice because he has to, because again, I was going to say, the radical left hates him because they think he deceived them because they agreed on that manifesto and that manifesto is seriously a leftist dream and he agreed from the Green New Deal, getting rid of your planes. No more airplane trips. Remember the crazy senator from Hawaii Do you like the Green New Deal I love it very much, he said. Oh okay, well youre the senator from Hawaii, thats right, the beautiful island of Hawaii. She said, Under the Green New Deal you basically cant fly in an airplane. Oh thats a problem. So they said theyd build a bridge from the mainland to Hawaii. Its 2,000 miles long but these are minor details. Remember her when they explained to her that planes are out, cows are out. Cows, they dont want cattle, they dont want cows. Did they withdraw that one That was a tough one, wasnt it They dont want cows, bad for the ozone layer. Who would even think of that Youd got to be sick to even think it, okay Give me a break. Give me a break and I guess under that theory this big guy is next, hes next. No, its a sick deal going on there. To do it the way they want would cost 100 trillion. Thats more money than this country could earn in 1,000 years to do it right.  We dont like that building, the windows are too large. Okay, lets rip it down and build a new one. What windows are you going to have Youre not going to have windows anymore. Environmental. They love wind too, right The big windmills, I always say, the greatest graveyard in the world for birds, just walk under a windmill. You will see more dead birds than you will ever imagine, whats happening, including eagles. You know, in California they put you in jail if you shoot a bald eagle, right You go to jail, right These windmills are knocking them out of the sky all day long. Its unbelievable, and yet they want wind, and wind also is very, its very hard to store the electricity from wind. So if you go home and you want to watch television because President Trump is on and you want to watch one of his very brilliant State of the Union addresses, if the wind isnt blowing, the husband looks at the wife, says, Darling, Im sorry, you cant watch tonight. The wind is not blowing. Sorry, you cant watch tonight. The wind is not blowing. And she looks at me, I like the old days. Its much better. But the rhetoric of Biden and the radical left puts your law enforcement in serious danger. Last weekend, two Los Angeles sheriffs deputies were ambushed and shot at point blank range. And we have everybody looking for that creep that did it. I called him an animal the other night. I said, Hes an animal, and we were challenged by some people on the left. Hes not an animal. Hes a human being. Hes not a human being. They got to find him. They got to find him. And the penalty has to be very fast, very swift and very, very severe. You cant do that. We call for the death penalty if you kill a policeman. You know that, right But the anti police demonstrators, they cheered and cheered when they saw this. And then they tried to stop them from even getting into the hospital. As president, Ill always support the heroes of law enforcement and Ill fight to ensure that criminals who murder police officers do indeed get the death penalty. They want prisoners to vote too, they wanted to. I said, So what about the Boston bomber Remember Bernie Sanders He wanted all prisoners to have. And I said, Does that mean everybody Yes. So we sent in a question, Does that include the Boston bomber Is he entitled to a vote And even Bernie is going, Oh man, lets get into a different question. This is not a good question. But we want to get that, we want to take care of it. If you look at all of the problems that we have, you look at crime, even somebody brought it up today, were doing a great job relative to other countries on the coronavirus. You know how many names we have Like 22 different names. I call it the China virus. Were doing a great job. But if you want to really see a great job, take New York and some of these other Democrat run states out of it. Youll see numbers that are unbelievable because New York had a very, very hard time. A lot of bad things happened. But you take a few of the states out and youll really see numbers. But by comparison to other countries and by almost all metrics, weve done an incredible job, including the job of helping the world with ventilators and all of the things that we built. And I think our task force has been incredible. And Mike Pence has done a great job. Biden opposes the death penalty for cop killers or mass murderers. Biden says he wants to protect black lives, but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of African American citizens. The Democrat partys war on cops has already led to surging homicides in Democrat controlled cities. Yet Biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide. They ask him, What about nationwide What about the fact that you just had your Democrat national convention Where, by the way, we had far many more viewers, millions and millions of more viewers. We had millions of more. I thought it was a great thing. Did anybody hear Herschel Walker that night It was  well. You talk about a good football player. He was some player. What a great guy. But all of them, everybody. The first lady did great, Ivanka did great. They all did, they did great. We had some  and some incredible stories, some very sad stories when you look and see what happened. But Bidens plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest the domestic terrorists. Joe Biden is a weak person. Hes always been a weak person. And that was in prime time. And prime time was 25 years ago. And let me tell you, hes not old. I always defend him on this. I have friends that are 85, 89, 92, 95, and theyre 100%. Theres just something wrong with Joe. Hes off, okay Hes off, and I have no problem saying it anymore when I watch the disinformation, because this is not disinformation. This is fact. If hes elected, his radical supporters wont just be causing mayhem on the streets, theyll be running the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Education. And most importantly, they will put many judges on the United States Supreme Court. We cant have that. Well have a totally different country radical left judges. And that has to do with the Second Amendment. It has to do with right to life, it has to do with so many different things that will turn your world upside down. And theyll have one, two, three or four, whoever is the next president. And hopefully, thats going to be us. Not me, us. Its us. But I put it, and think of this, by the end of the term, well have approximately 300 brand new, great federal judges, Court of Appeals judges 300, which is a record, 300. Give or take a little, tiny bit, but 300. Nobody thought that was possible. I want to thank President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Nobody gets left one opening. A federal judgeship is a big deal. Nobody gets left any openings. He gave us 142 openings. Thank you very much. What happened They thought Hillary was going to win, so they didnt push it. And then they said, Wait a minute, these polls are getting a little close at the end. And they tried like hell to get some judges approved, but it didnt work. Thats what happens. You got to go and you have to act fast. You got to get it done. Get it done, right We get things done like nobodys ever gotten it. Oh, he was a great president. He was great. He left 142 judges for the Republicans. He was a great president, right If you are of that side of the plate of that ideology, and you had a president that left you 142 federal judgeships, I dont think youd rate him as doing a good job. Hey, look at what happened in Iraq, look at what happened with ISIS, look at what happened with our military, look at what happened with our vets. Our vets are better taken care of now than theyve ever been in the history of our country, but never forget they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. And thats true. Thats true. And were winning the fight and were winning this election. This election, we are doing well. They refuse to say it. They refuse to say it, and they hate to say it. It just drives them crazy. But that night, remember they started off by saying, This will be a very short evening for Donald Trump. That was Donald Trump in those days. Now, its President Trump. I lost all my friends because of this position. I had friends. Hey, Don, lets go to dinner. Okay. Good, Richard. Ill go. Hey, Don, lets go. Okay, Larry. Ill see you later. Ill meet you at a restaurant in New York. Everybody was nice and loose. You could have a great conversation, and you dont want to know what we talked about. Its just none of your business, but we were loose. All of a sudden, Id become president of the United States. And these are a lot of  I know a lot of important people. Actually, the people I like the best are the people that are less successful because it makes you feel so powerful. I always say, never go out with a successful person. Youll understand. But I know a lot of very successful people, very, very successful. And now they call me up, Mr. President, sir, would you like to get together sometime I say, Loosen up. Yes, call me Donald. Youve known me for 30 years, call me Donald. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. President, I appreciate it. I lost all my friends because its respect for the office, lets face it. Its different. They used to be loose, they used to be great. You could sit back, Im not a drinker, but you could sit back and have a drink, whatever the hell youre drinking. And now, you cant do that anymore. You cant do it anymore. So I have to rely on people in Congress to be my friends. And we just happened to have a couple tonight. And one of them whos been a great warrior and hes doing a fantastic job, I just saw you on television by the way, Bryan. Does everybody know Bryan Steil Bryan Steil young, handsome, but a warrior. When the fake impeachment happened, it was a total fake, what did we finish up with the Republicans 197 to nothing, right at the house. One night, it was a fake impeachment. I got impeached over a perfect phone call of congratulations to the president of Ukraine, who I never met before. If youre going to do something, at least know him a little bit, right I never met him. And then they said it was eight times, quid pro quo. That was Adam Schiff. Shifty Schiff, right And he went before Congress and he repeated my conversation, except that he made it all up. Remember he repeated it And then I said, Ah, fortunately, we had that whole thing essentially recorded. Im glad I did, but these are very deceptive, deceiving, sick people. And I said, Well, he lied because there was no quid pro quo. It was a perfect conversation. But by that time it was too late because they had already embarrassed themselves by doing it. And Nancy Pelosi was all set. She loved doing it, she from day one, but she thought it was what Schiff said. When she saw the conversation, she said to her people, What the hell did you get me into So they could have dropped it, but they said, Lets give it a shot. Hes another beauty, Mitt Romney. Hes a real beauty. He couldnt get elected dog catcher right now in Utah. So we have another great one and hes really a friend of mine, and hes been solid. He loves his country and he loves his state, Glenn Grothman. Glenn, thank you very much, friend. And a man who just got elected, and hes from an area that I know very well, we did very well, we got our big, big, fat, beautiful contract that produced lots of jobs. But he was taking a legends place, so its never easy to replace a legend. Thats Duffy, in case anybody  And they was running and we did a lot of work for him, and it was great. And he reacted very well under pressure. A lot of people dont react well under pressure. They choke, they choke. He was under a lot of pressure and he ended up winning by like 18 points. And now, hes your congressman. Hes doing a great job. You got to vote for all these people on November 3rd, Tom Tiffany. Thank you, Tom. And we have a great congressional candidate, Derrick Van Orden. Wheres Derrick Derrick, good luck. I hear good things, Derrick. You got my total support. I hear very good things. I could only be supportive. Our record is like 222 and three, so I dont like to have a loss. And I support you a 100%, you know that. You have my total endorsement, all right I hear youre fantastic. All right. And your former congressman who I hope is making a lot of money in the private sector because he deserves it, especially his wife, Rachel deserves it, shes just fantastic. Hes fantastic because I know hes coming back into government in some form. He can come with us. He can stay here. He can maybe run for governor or maybe do something, Sean Duffy. Sean Duffy. No, but he was the World Champion tree climber. And I love sports, right Anytime you know the world champion at anything, but especially that, and Ill never forget. I was asking about it. How was it was He said, well, he broke his back numerous times. He broke a lot of bones. I said, Let me ask you a question. How much harder was it to go up the tree than down He said, It was easy going up. The hard part was coming down because if he missed, that was where the danger was, right That was where the danger. But many times, world champion. Could you still do it today A little bit heavier, he said. You got to carry a little bit more weight. Thats all right. Thats not a good sign though, right Anyway, great job. We love having you Rachel, thank you very much. You are a friend. Fox and friends, and plenty of other places, right A lot of personality, a lot of personality. Rachel, shes been our friend from day one, I think from day one. And her fantastic family too. Tonight, were also praying for everyone in the path of Hurricane Sally. Were out there working very hard. We are working in Florida and Alabama and Georgia. We have FEMA. We have everybody there. We just finished in  take a look, we just went to Louisiana, Texas. Were getting hit by some big hurricanes, but we have it under control. Really good. Our coast guard has been fantastic, by the way. Unbelievable, the bravery. They go into these storms. They go into these storms. They say, How dangerous is it Sir, its very dangerous. I say, Yeah. All right. He said, Would you like to try it sometime I say, Admiral, no, thank you. Ill take a pass. I think they might have a problem with me doing it, but I will tell you, they are  In Texas, they saved 16,000 people two years ago, the coast guard, US Coast Guard. I think theres no brand to me, thats gone up more than the US Coast Guard. So its great that were getting them new ships. Those ships are all coming in. Nice new ones, all built in the USA, beautiful ones. Most of them have already arrived. My administration will be by their side through every step. Were working again, very, very hard in the Panhandle. The Panhandle, we love the Panhandle. It got hit hard. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. We passed record tax cuts and regulation cuts. Nobodys ever done more, more than anybody else has ever done to keep our family farms in the family. Weve virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax. So if you die in 100 years from now, and you have children who you love as opposed to children that you can stand  is anybody here they have children that they dont like, or perhaps cant stand Because if you do, dont listen to the rest of this. But if you have a family that you love and you have a small business or farm or whatever, they were being put out of business. Theyd have to go and borrow the money to pay the estate tax, the death tax. And it was a terrible thing. We got rid of it, so now you can leave your farm, your small business to your family. And just hope they remember you every once in a while. Its always a difficult situation, but it was. It was ruining farms. Theyd have to go out and sell the farm, theyd have to go out and get partnerships, theyd have to go out and borrow money from banks. And then all of a sudden theyre in foreclosure proceedings and theyve never done that before. They dont have to worry about that anymore. If you love your family, thats a big deal. Theyve been trying to get that, Sean, for what, 30 years theyve been trying to get that, right Especially for the farmers, because its that kind of a business. Its a great business, but its day to day. You have a bad crop, all of a sudden you cant pay interest on a loan to pay your state tax, right And they lose their farm. So were not going to have that anymore. We achieved American energy independence for the first time. Totally independent. We dont have to be in those far away places unless we want to be. Biden pledged to abolish American oil, American jail, clean coal, natural gas. He said the fracking, I told you that, but were not going to let him get away. Well be bringing that up on occasion. For 47 years, Joe Biden crushed the dreams of Wisconsin workers and enriched foreign countries. Thats what happened. Before I got here, what was happening with Japan And we pay our deep respects to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a great friend of all of ours, a great friend of mine. Hes going to be leaving office very soon, like in a matter of a day. And he was a great gentleman. Hes a tough negotiator, Ill tell you that. He made very good deals against the United States, but hes somebody thats going to be missed. Hes a great gentleman. He championed every special interest, Biden, every special interest. And he sold out on trade. He sold out like almost nobody ever before. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administrations job killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. You ever hear of that beauty That would have really hit you. In 2017, I signed a historic executive order making government policy to buy American and hire American. Im watching this Biden and hes got his sign in front, Buy American. Oh, by American. Ive been saying that for like 20 years, right Where the hell has this guy been They were actually accusing him of plagiarism. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to Chinas rampant theft of Wisconsin jobs. And its all jobs, but you got hit particularly hard. Biden has vowed to remove those tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging. He wants to take the tariffs off that are paying us tens of billions of dollars a year. I fought like hell to keep them into the China deal and he wants to remove them. So tens of billions of dollars, billions and billions, I gave it to the farmers. I gave it to a lot of people, but I gave most of it by far, to the US Treasury. He wants to take them off. So let me just ask you just a very innocent question. Theres a young man, about four years old up front, I think he could give the answer. Who do you think would like to have China How do you think China would feel about this election In one case, they paid billions and billions of dollars a month to the US. We never got ever, 25 cents from China. In the other case, he said, Were going to take them off. I think they might be inclined to go for Sleepy Joe. This is like a dream for China. Joe Bidens agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA. Its very simple. So we did many things. Not only China, not only the 28 billion farmers. We did so much and Im proud to announce that Im doing even more to support Wisconsin farmers. Starting next week, my administration is committing an additional, youve been asking for this for a long time, 13 billion in relief to help farmers recover from the China virus, including Wisconsins incredible dairy, cranberry and ginseng farmers who got hurt badly. Been after that money for a long time. When the Wisconsin timber industry was threatened, I imposed tariffs on dumped foreign timber and subsidized products, saving many, many timber jobs in your state. If Joe Biden gets in, the radical left will shut down Wisconsins timber production for environmental reasons. Do you believe that Oh, boy. Its so sad to see it, and that would happen. But we cant let that happen. Weve come too far. Were so good. If that virus hadnt hit us, and it did, and it hit the whole world, but if it hadnt hit us, we would have numbers the likes of which nobody thought were even remotely possible. But it did, and we saved a lot of lives. They keep saying, Oh, they just  By the way, if we had two people die, they would have said he did a terrible job. If we had 100 people die, if we had 1000, no matter what we do. We have trade deals. We announced a trade deal, everybody is saying how great it is. Schumer and Pelosi see it, they have no idea what the deal is, We dont like the deal. Did you look at it Oh, of course, we looked at it. It doesnt have tariffs. Oh no, it does have tariffs. They know nothing about the deal. Automatically, anything we do, they just take the reverse. But you know what Id probably do it to them too, so I cant complain. And perhaps no issue have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, weve achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended the catch and release. You know what catch and release is You catch up them, they may be a killer, they may be a criminal at the highest order, you take their name. Then youre supposed to bring them to a court, like Perry Mason, right But we actually catch them, take their name, release them, say, Come back in about four years for your court case. We ended all this stuff. And you think that was easy It wasnt easy, let me tell you. It was tough, but we have a really good, secure border. And the president of Mexico has been terrific. We right now have 27,000 soldiers from Mexico guarding our border, free of charge. We stopped asylum fraud, and weve deported 20,000 gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens of the worst kind. Were enforcing the clear requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient and not reliant on welfare. They have to sign a document. We invested 2. 5 trillion in the US military, including major contracts to build new warships that helped save the historic shipyard in Marinette. How about that I was there two months ago. Marinette. Thats a great company, but it was having a hard time. And now, theyre building, what was that, like 6 billion worth of ships And their beauties. Theyve started already, and we worked very hard on that. And we had a lot of help from your congressman on that one, because a lot of people wanted that contract. But we got it for Wisconsin, remember that. We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in nearly 75 years. Thats right, the Space Force. The fact is, and somebody said it on the other side, an opponent said whether you like it or not, Trump actually did more as president than he promised during the campaign. Like Space Force, thats a big deal. Think of it army, navy, air force, marine.  Think of it, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, right. Think of it. I mean, thats all you heard your whole life, right. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, Coast Guard and now, we have the Space Force. You know what a big deal, first time in 75 years, its a new one. Last one was 75 years ago. The Air Force, right. Thats a big thing. I never talked about that on the campaign, I never even thought about it. When I became president, I said, We have to do this. Because I saw what Russia was doing, and I saw what China was doing. And, theyve created their Space Forces, I said, What are we going to do, not have it. Its going to end up being maybe your most important or certainly one of your most important because thats where its at, in terms of defense, in terms of offense. We passed VA choice and VA accountability for our great veterans that we had the other day. Veterans satisfaction, 91 percent, the highest score weve ever received. You havent noticed, remember years ago, every story, every night, the Nightly News, youd always have horrible stories about the VA, you dont see it anymore. Now, I dont want to give them any ideas, because theyll search all over the country for a vet whos unhappy. Im hurting myself by telling this story. This is not a good story. But remember that, every night youd have these horror stories about the VA. You dont see that anymore. 91 percent approval rating. I kept my promise recognized the Capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieve the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace and, you saw that two days ago, UAE, Bahrain, Israel, nobody thought it was even possible. I saw John Kerry on television the other day. It is not possible. Then we waited a little while. He went very, very strong, It is not possible. And, it was not only possible, we have many countries that are joining us very soon. We killed the founder and the leader, the vicious leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. And, we also took out the worlds number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many, many troops and many people, all over the world. Qasem Soleimani is dead, hes dead, bad guy, bad guy, very bad guy. We kept America out of new wars and were bringing our troops back home. No one has been more wrong, more often than sleepy Joe Biden. He voted for the Iraq War, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military. I took over a military that was totally depleted, like. Hillary Clinton deleted, as opposed to depleted, she depleted them too but, she deleted 33,000 emails. When is somebody going to pull the spring Ah, come on fellows. No, thats terrible. 33,000 emails. Try going to court sometime on a civil case, and when you go before the judge, hell say, Did you delete those emails Did you get rid of those texts Did you this, Right. And, now they caught Weissmann and all these guys cleaning their phones because they were under investigation, and they cleaned their phones. How many were there 21, but they were like 33 phones. And yet, look what they do to General Flynn, and some of these people that did nothing. They cleaned their criminals, yeah, thats criminal, its criminal, theyre criminals. They talk and talk and talk, theyre criminals. They clean their phone, so you dont have any of the information, but thats a big problem for them, I would imagine. Its a disgrace that they can do it. But, Hillary got rid of She deleted and acid-wash, right. Who acid-washed Did you ever And, she also used to bang them with a hammer, remember that, we forgot that, right. So, lets see what happens with all of that stuff. I think Bill Barrs doing an excellent job, I have to tell you. And, hes fighting a very bad establishment in Washington. Theres some bad apples in that whole deal. But, if you think that Biden opposed the mission to take out of Osama bin Laden, he was against it. He opposed the killing of Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS, what a mistake. And, he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for America and the world, I dont think so. I dont think so. Its not been too positive. If it were up to sleepy, Joe Biden, bin Ladin and Soleimani, would be alive. ISIS would still be on the rampage and China would now be the dominant power in the world and there not even close, I will tell you. We have weaponry, the likes of which nobodys seen. 2.5 trillion buys you some good stuff, especially when we have the finest scientific minds and military minds in the world. We have weapons, the likes of which nobodys seen, and just hope to God, we never have to use them. I say that, and I say, its strongly. Hope that we never have to use them. My attitude was that, and Ive learned this a long time ago, by having them, we keep ourselves out of war, as opposed to bringing ourselves in war. But, we have built and created weapons, the likes of which this world has never seen before. And, we dont have to talk about it too much, nor do I really want to talk about it. When I ban travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic, he said, Hes xenophobic. What does that mean Joe, tell me. Biden also opposed my plan to ban Europe, I saw what was happening in France and Spain and Italy, and highly infected, we banned Europe. If we had insisted and listened to Joe and insisted on doing what so many other people said doing, which is, You dont have to do the ban. Hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died from the plague. Biden was willing to sacrifice American lives, on the altar of open borders. And now, I hear him talking, he should have followed me. This guy did the swine flu, right, it was a catastrophe. And, the man that headed up the swine flu, I wont use his name because Id like to have him have a nice evening, because I cant imagine the democrats are thrilled. He said, It was a horrible job, we had no idea what we were doing, it was a disaster. He said, It was a disaster. And now, Bidens telling us how to do what were doing so well on, what other countries are calling me and congratulating me on the incredible job. And I got sleepy, Joe Biden, trying to tell me how to do it. And, his own man who headed it up, swine flu, its H1N1 swine flu. Joe called it, N1H1. I keep saying Joe, Joe, its H1N1, right. I said, Its easier to remember because H comes before N, but he cant do it. And then, you saw what he said the other day under a Harris-Biden administration. That was a disaster. I never said under a Pence Trump administration, he said, Under a Harris-Biden administration. And, what made it worse, is she said the same thing. That was terrible, right. Sean, right. Did you hear that They are a disaster together. Through our historic relief programs, we saved more than 1 million Wisconsin jobs and 87,000 Wisconsin businesses, thats not too bad. And, Biden would demolish all of those games, and weve done similar things in other states. He would destroy your social security, totally destroy it, and destroy protections for preexisting conditions. They want to go to social medicine, they want to go to social You know that, right. You do know that. They want social healthcare where you dont Remember Obama 28 times, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan, that didnt work out too well, right. Why havent they looked into that one, 28 times. Well, under Medicare for All, but its basically socialized healthcare, you will never have your doctor, you will never have your plan. Youll have horrible healthcare. Youre going to wait long times, long times. And, he wants to wipe out 180 million private healthcare plans that people love, 180 million plans. I dont think so. I dont think hes going to make it. How do you get elected Lets say youre doing, not only here, lets say Texas, right, hes against oil, hes against God and hes against guns. Thats a tough combination in Texas. How does that apply Now, hes against religion. They wont open these blue states, they will not open your churches. They wont open them. And, I think they have an ulterior motive. One thing they have is, probably everything opens on November 4th, you understand that. And, they better be careful, those paper ballots you talk about, a bad thing, just get out and vote, get out and vote. And, if you have to go that route, make sure they have it counted. And, they know its trouble. They just had another election today, fellows, where its a disaster. The votes come in, they have no idea, they cant count them. And, I dont mean theyre off by a little bit, theyre off by 20 percent, 25 percent. Theres fraud. Theres missing ballots. They have a woman in New York who is a terrible congresswoman, you know that. Carolyn Maloney. They gave her an election, they cant even find the ballots. And, they gave her a victory, and they cant find that the guy that is against her, who did very well, even though hes even more progressive, I dont even know what she is. Ive known her for 25 years. I dont think shes progressive. I think shes whatever she has to be. But this guy, probably or possibly beat her. So, rightfully hes not too happy. And, they called the election for her and they cant find the ballots. Wants to force you to provide free healthcare to illegal aliens, you remember he raised his hand, that will totally drain your wonderful Medicare. Remember the question up there, hes standing up,  Who is willing to give free healthcare to illegal aliens. And, everybody raises their hands like fast. Kamala was right up there. By the way, that will destroy your country, you do know that. Because you cant afford it, and Bidens looking around, Oh, they all raise their hand. He goes, remember. I remember. I said, Well, there it goes, the election for him. Hes end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by over 700 percent. And, thats the deal he made with Bernie Sanders, opening the flood gates to terror, afflicted nations. But I predict the Sanders people are going to vote for us, like they did the last time. We had a tremendous. Because they love my stance on trade, because I know trade, and I was telling him much more so, than even Bernie. But Bernie, is right on that subject, that other countries, including our so-called allies are ripping us off on trade. Biden opposes, school choice and vowed to ban charter schools. Did you know that Does everybody like charter schools Everybody likes choice. In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. Were all set up to get it done. A vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. Its really a vote for the American dream, instead of letting Washington change us. And, despite all that weve all gone through. We are changing Washington, thats whats been happening. And, just in conclusion, and I hate concluding with you because I like you. I like you. I dont know why the hell I like Wisconsin, but for some reason. You know what helps so, as you know for weeks before the election, she was four up, crooked Hillary, four up, four up, four up, I kept saying, Do you think were going to win And I will say, Sean Duffy said, Youre going to win. He actually said, Dont worry about it. Right, Sean. I said, Sean do you think were going to win here I dont like these polls, but four down. He said, Sir, youre going to win so easy. And, early in the night, they said, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. And, so when Im here, speaking in the freezing cold, Im lucky they had I said, Do you think we have Its very warm in New York and very warm in Washington, it was hot actually. And I said, Do you think we have a coat on the plane They said, Yes. I said, Whats the temperature Sir, its 49 degrees. I said, How about giving me a coat They have everything on Air Force One, thats the great thing. Got more televisions in any plane in history. Theyve got televisions in closets, on floors, on ceiling. But, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And, we will end our reliance on China once and for all. Well make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in the great state of Wisconsin. We will rapidly return to full employment, thats happening very fast, soaring economies and the record prosperity will be even greater than it was, last year. We will hire more police, increase penalties on assaults of law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities. And, we will ban sanctuary cities, which are deadly. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious Liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear Arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless Foreign Wars. And, you remember with me, they thought because of my personality, they said, Hell be in war the first week. What happened to the war Remember, we were going to be in war with North Korea. Hillary would have been in war with North Korea. It would have been a nasty one too. But remember, everybody said, I was going to be in war. Everybody said, Oh, maybe Ill do something with social security. And, I did. I saved it and made it stronger. And now, Im going to make it even stronger. And, theyre going to get rid of your social security because everythings going to come collapsing down. You will have a depression. If he gets in, theyre going to raise interest rates. Theyre going to raise your taxes, you will have a depression. The likes of which this country has never seen before. And, your 401ks and your stocks and jobs will go down in flames. I just say it here, hopefully were never going to experience it, but thats whats going to happen. We will maintain Americas unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which Ive already signed. Further reduced health insurance premiums, or the costs of prescription drugs, which are coming down now. You know, I signed favored nations clauses, their drug companies are not happy with me, I will tell you. They never thought it was possible and rebate clauses. They never thought anybody would do that to them. They made enough money for a long time. Its time, you got a big break. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security. And, we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always, you have a pledge. We will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And, NASA is now the hottest space center anywhere in the world. And, when I took over three and a half years ago, there was grass growing in the runways, you know that it was closed down, it was a mess. We are now the hottest in the world. You see whats going up. And, weve got a lot of rich guys sending them up too. I liked that better. I said, Let them do it. Rich guys like rockets, I dont know, they like rocket, boom. I see dollars going right up, but they need a good place to launch. We have the best places. We have the best places, so its been incredible what weve done with NASA. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. Were already there again. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And, we will live by the timeless works of our national motto, In God We Trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America, and standing up for the State of Wisconsin. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get everybody and get out and vote, November 3rd. From Milwaukee to Madison, from Oshkosh to La Crosse. From Green Bay, how the Packers doing so far Good team, good people, to right here in Give me the proper pronunciation. Thats right, thank you, thats what I said. We inherit the legacy of generations of Wisconsin Patriots, who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed a wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And, you havent seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, with the incredible people of Wisconsin, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you. Thank you."
Fayetteville,Sep9,2019," Thank you everybody. Thank you and Vice President Mike Pence, thank you very much. Incredible. And, hello to Fayetteville. Hello, Fayetteville. Its great to be here in North Carolinas ninth congressional district with the hardworking patriots who believe in faith, family, God and country. Thank you. Thank you. Tomorrow youll head to the polls to elect a congressman who always puts America first, Dan Bishop. Ive just come from a meeting with North Carolina officials representing communities hit by Hurricane Dorian and I expressed the unwavering solidarity of the American people, we are behind you 100%. 100%. The prayers of our entire nation are with the citizens of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and everyone else that was in the storms path, and I will say I was called by the government of The Bahamas and were helping with The Bahamas. They were hit so hard. They were hit so hard. Who would believe it We pledged the full support of the federal government through every step of the rebuilding process. And I will say, North Carolina in our country probably got hit the hardest. That was a little bit of a surprise, but I know one thing about North Carolina. You can take it and youll build it quickly and youll build it beautifully. And, youll be back sooner then anybody ever thought and itll be better then ever. Right No doubt about it. I also want to give a special recognition to the many non-governmental organizations doing so much to help people recover from Dorian, in particular, Franklin Graham. Hes a wonderful guy. Hes got an organization, Samaritans Purse, based right here in North Carolina and the work that Franklin and his family and all of those that are with Franklin Graham we want to thank them. Special, great people. Great People. Thank you Franklin. Thank you. Incredible job. He does such a great job. All over, whenever theres a problem you see Samaritans Purse and Franklin and his people. We love the people of this state and we will never ever leave your side. North Carolina will truly recover so fast. I know you people so well. Lets not even talk about it. Lets not even talk about it. Were here tonight to discuss the extraordinary progress were making as a nation and how to ensure this amazing resurgence keeps on going and going strong. In just over two years, weve taken this big beautiful ship and its being turned around very quickly. Nobody thought this would happen. You know we won the greatest election, certainly one of them, but maybe the greatest, but we won lets say one of the greatest, this way I wont be criticized. Theyll say, You know, George Washington had a great election too. The fake news right. The fake news. But, we won one of the greatest elections in history and because of that, and you would be in big trouble if we didnt, I can tell you that. Youd be Instead of going up we were heading in the wrong direction. We have the number one economy anywhere in the world. And every time I meet a foreign leader, almost every time, they say, Congratulations on what youve done with the economy. I said, I didnt do it. I just set a certain path. The people of the United States did it. Number one anywhere in the world. And they tried to do the recession thing. You know, they tried the Russia thing. That didnt work. They tried many other things. I always say, The media and their partner, the Democrats. I wouldnt mind fighting the Democrats, but we really have to look at it as a two-some. Its the media and the Democrats. Its one and the same. Were rebuilding our military, defending our sovereignty and reclaiming our dignity as a nation. America is winning again and America is respected again. They respect America. By the way, I have about 10 women in the front row and you come from North Carolina and they travel all over the place. Hold up your hands. These are great women. I see them so much, and I must say they have other things to do. They look rich as hell to me, I dont know. How many is this How many rallies have you come too They cant count. They said all of them except for two. Thats a lot of rallies and it all emanates from this area. Thats so great. Well, at least you wont have to travel so far for this one, right Thank you very much for being here. We really appreciate it. Well, we appreciate it. We appreciate it. Thank you. Really incredible people. But you know, weve created six million new jobs since election day and I couldnt say that in my initial rallies because nobody would have believed it. Six million new jobs. More Americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country. Almost 160 million Americans, nobody would have thought that was possible. We wouldnt have been able to say it actually. Weve now had 13 straight months of wage gains of at least 3%, so the people that work so hard You remember I used to say during the rallies before we won, people worked two jobs, three jobs and they made less money then they made 21 years before and now wages are going up, the economy is doing great and jobs have never been better. So importantly, more than 70 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Nearly 600,000 Americans entered the labor force last month alone. Think of that. And the unemployment rate for African-Americans just reached another brand new, yesterday, all time low in the history of our country. How do you lose that debate Remember I used to say, Why do you have to lose Well, now you have the best unemployment numbers, employment and unemployment numbers, that youve ever had as African-Americans, as Asian-Americans, as Hispanic-Americans. The best numbers weve ever had, and by the way, African-American youth unemployment has also reached the lowest level ever recorded in history. And, the labor force participation rate for women is at the highest level now in 15 years, and soon will be 35 years, and soon, I promise, will probably end up being better than ever. I can tell you the unemployment numbers for women are the best theyve been now in 72 years. So, I always say kiddingly, Im sorry I didnt make it historic, but you know what Its going to be historic very soon. Itll be historic very soon. And, here in North Carolina, over 230,000 more people now have jobs and small business formation has skyrocketed by more than 25%. Amazing. But, the radical democrats want to dismantle, demolish, and destroy everything that youve gained, and they will do it, and it wont take that long. And, thats why we need Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy. We need them. We need them going down. We need them going down to congress and helping. But, they can do it. Its also why we need four more years. It has to See, its like a plant. Weve changed things, right Keep America Great. Weve changed things, but its gotta grow. Its gotta develop those roots. And, once it does, its going to be very hard for them to destroy what weve done. Very hard. And, thats really why I consider this election Look, we had a very, very special day in 2016. It was a very special day. Very special day. It was an incredible day, an incredible month, an incredible year, and I dont know that you can ever compare anything to it. But, I can say this, 2020 is essentially just as important, because theyll try and take it away. Whether it has to do with religion. Our evangelicals are here tonight, and theyre all over the place. And, what weve done for them, and for religion, is so important. You know, the other side, I dont think theyre big believers Theyre not big believers in religion. That I can tell you. You listen to some of them. Theyre trying, and theyre trying put out little statements. Theyre not working too well. Little statements that are a little bit, sort of, not too good, huh What is the word we want to use Yeah, a little Nah. Nah. Theyre pushing a little hard, and its not working. To stop the far left, you must vote in tomorrows special election. So important. Or, get your votes in early. I think a lot of Who voted early for Dan Bishop Good. Well, thats good, but the big thing is tomorrow. Tomorrow is the election, and youll get out. To protect your family, you must defeat open borders. And, you have Democrat named Dan McCready, and he wants open borders. He wants sanctuary cities. Hes not going to protect your Second Amendment. Hes doing nothing on your Sec You know, North Carolinas a very big Second Amendment state. And, Dan Bishop, Greg Murphy, these guys, theyre going to protect your Second Amendment. But, one of the biggest issues in this election is, in fact, sanctuary cities. McCready supports sanctuary city policies that force prisons and jails to release criminal aliens directly into your neighborhoods. Get out. Go ahead. Go into the neighborhood. Go into Whats your neighborhood. Where do you What Rutherford County Okay. So, how do you feel about having them released, hardened, horrible criminals into Rutherford County I dont think so. But, your whole state Honestly Can I be honest Its crazy whats happening. This whole thing with sanctuary cities, and you go to California, which is so many sanctuary cities, they dont know whats happening out there. You have people that want to get ride of those sanctuary cities, they just arent able to do it with the people that get elected. A lot of illegal voting going on out there, by the way, a lot of illegal voting. In August, McCready said it was the right call to set illegal alien criminals loose in the great state Im using the words great state. He doesnt.  Of North Carolina. With the support and encouragement of McCready, sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina have released thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into your communities, and you see it. You see it. The charges against these freed criminals includes sexual assault, robbery, drug crimes, kidnapping, and homicide. Murder. Why would you do it Why would you do it What is it Explain it. Just recently, Mecklenburg County set free an illegal alien charged with first-degree rape and crimes against a child. Support for sanctuary cities is disloyalty to American citizens, and McCready wants sanctuary cities with all of their protections for people that are serious criminals. Tomorrow is your chance to send a clear message to the America-hating left, and its gotta be. And, by the way, were building that wall, and its going up very big. Very big. And, you think its easy to get money when you have the entire Democrat party And, they control the House, and we want to change that. We want to flip the house. Well get so much. Itll be amazing what we can do for our country. We dont want dangerous criminal aliens roaming free in North Carolina. We want to take care of it. This state should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. Our great Republican candidate, Dan Bishop, will fight with everything he has to stop sanctuary cities and defend the people of this great state. Dan, come on up. Dan Bishop, everyone. Get out and vote. Come on up, Dan. We need a doctor. A doctor in the house, please. A doctor, please. Doctor in the house. Thank you. Take your time, please. Take your time. Weve got plenty of time. Thank you. Take your time. Thank you, Doctor. Take your time. People have been standing outside for two days to get in, so this happens. Thank you. Thank you, Doctor. Doing better Good. Thats good. Thats good. Thats great. Thats really great. Thank you Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thats really great. Thank you very much. I guess Dans speech wasnt so good. What do you think Thats great. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Dan. That was a good job. That was a good job. He means it, too. Hes great. Go out and vote tomorrow for Dan Bishop, please. So, weve had great support over the last six months in particular from a man who happens to be your senator right now, and we need him to keep going, because he has been fantastic. And, I believe hes here tonight. I just came in. The weather wasnt so great to be traveling today, and they said, Maybe we could skip North Carolina today, sir. So, I said, No, thank you. I said, No, thank you. Can you imagine And, by the way, I have to say, we have a big crowd in here, right You havent seen outside. Thousands and thousands of people who couldnt get in. And, when people wait two or three days to come in and especially these first rows, I just want to tell you we really thank you. Incredible. But, Thom Tillis has really worked with us over the last period of time. Hes recently introduced a bill to give American victims the right to sue sanctuary cities. Thats a big deal. And hold them accountable for the lives that theyve shattered. But, to pass the bill, we need more Republicans. Tomorrow there is another crucial special election, and we have a fantastic guy running in that one, too, Republican Greg Murphy. It looks like hes in good shape, but youve got to get it out. So, I want to introduce Thom Tillis, and I want to introduce Greg Murphy. I want to thank you both. Thank you. Thank you, Thom, and thank you, Greg. So, Greg Murphy is looking to, like Dan, cut your taxes, defend your Second Amendment, support our policies, really, really support our military and our veterans. We have rebuilt our military. Greg Murphy, come on up for a second here. Greg Murphy. Come up. Come up, Greg. Come on up, Greg. Come on up, Greg. Just for a second. Then, well get back to business. Weve got to do this, and I dont know. Hes been a great champ Thank you, Greg. Come. Please. Good luck tomorrow, Greg. Get out there and vote for those two guys. Theyre terrific. Were thrilled to be joined tonight by many more terrific Republican leaders. A man whos really been stepping up to the front. He defended Justice Kavanaugh when he was treated so badly. Ive never seen anything like the treatment that Justice Kavanaugh received. And, everybody respects him, and everybody likes him. And, I like him, and we used to fight like hell, right But, we dont fight anymore. We like each other a lot, and hes a special man. And, hes become a special friend. Senator Lindsay Graham. Another man who is a fighter I guess were all fighters. You have to be a fighter or youre not going to be here very long. I can tell you that. Weve got to fight them more than anybody else. But, a man whos done an incredible job in Washington, took over a rough situation, and hes become a real leader, and thats Republican Leader, Kevin McCarthy. Kevin. Kevins working so hard for so many different people. He wants to see Dan and Greg win so badly. Thank you for being here. Appreciate it, Leader. Representative David Rouzer. David, thank you. David Rouzer. Hes done a fantastic job. Our lieutenant governor who is going to be, I think, a highly competitive candidate for a very important race, Dan Forest. Thank you, Dan. Thank you very much, Dan. We also have North Carolina Republican Party Chair, Michael Whatley. What a job youve done. And, we have a man from North Carolina who loves this state. He fights so hard. He doesnt know what it is not to fight. You know who Im talking about They got it, Mark. Youre all screaming, Mark Meadows. Thats right. Hes great. So many. Jim Jordan, Andy Biggs, Gaetz, and I just got so By the way, Devin Nunez. Devin Nunez. How about Devin He was out there when it wasnt in vogue to be saying that Comey was a stone cold liar and leaker. But, he knew it all the time, Devin Nunez. But, Mark Meadows is pretty incredible, and do they love  but Mark Meadows has been incredible, and do they love him in your state. Do they love Mark Meadows. Thank you Mark. Also a friend of mine whos been with us from the beginning, hes not a politician but he might as well be one. He loves us. He loves this party and he loves your state, lives here, Louis DeJoy. One of the most successful people. Thank you, Louis and your wife is doing a great job Louis. And a very special thanks to my son, Don Junior and Kimberly. Great job. Did Don Junior give a good speech I heard that. They all said, He was on fire. Well, hes fighting. He loves this country. My son loves this country. My family loves this country, and two people, from your state, that the first lady, before she was first lady, she said, You know, there are two people that are unbelievable. Youve got to watch them. I said, Im not interested. Im too busy. No, no, no. You have to watch them. Theyre so great, theyre so smart. They love the country, they love you. Diamond and Silk. They are incredible. Incredible people. Thank you very much. Thank you, what a job, and theyre doing very well I have to tell you that. Our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100% pro-American. And by the way, so is Doug Collins, and so John Ratcliffe. Thank you fellows. Thank you. Two incredible fighters also. For decades our leaders put global interest and special interest ahead of your interest. You know that better than anybody, and this state knows it better than anybody. They traded away your factories, sold your future, squandered your tax dollars, sacrificed your security, and bogged us down in one foreign debacle after another. But all of that is changed. Were respected again. Theyre all saying, Oh, gee. I hope he doesnt do this or that. Theyve taken advantage of us for years, and I have to say sadly, in many cases its our allies that took the greatest advantage of this country. But now you finally have a president who understands that Im not supposed to be the president of the world, Im supposed to be the President of the United States of America. To bring back our jobs for other countries, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. Weve cut a record number of job killing regulations. No president, no longer how long they serve, has gotten anywhere even close to what weve done with regulations, and thats one of the reasons our economy is so good. And we have tremendous potential upward, and China wants to talk. They want to talk. Chinas lost three million jobs, thousands of companies are leaving China, the supply chain is crumbling because they cant pay the tariffs, and our country has taken over things that you wouldve never thought. As an example, hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs, and China is eating the cost, which the fake news doesnt want to tell you. And out of the tens of billions of dollars that weve taken in, because of the fact that our great American patriot farmers have been targeted by China, theyve been targeted, because they know the farmer is like Trump. I love the farmers. So they targeted the farmers, and I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny, how much was it, last year and the year before Tell me. It was 12 billion and it was 16 billion, and out of the tariffs that weve taken in, we gave to our farmers for distribution, hopefully very good distribution, hopefully very even distribution, weve given them 28 billion so that theyre whole. So that theyre whole. Nobody would ever do that. Nobody would ever do that, I can tell you that right now, and our farmers know we have to fight. I see it all the time, where some of the networks that are crazy, they have a group of farmers, in some cases they have groups of women, they say, What do you think of President Trump We like him a lot. Were with him all the way. And they want to turn off the cameras. They go crazy, but with the farmers you know that. You ever see that The 10 women. What do you think of President Trump We love him Boy would I like to put you on television, Ill tell you right now, and they cant turn off those cameras fast enough, but they say to the farmers, You voted for President Trump, are you happy And ever one of them said, He did things that no ones ever done before. Who would think of getting 12 billion plus 16 million, 28 billion, because theyve been targeted. Thats the amount I asked Sonny, I said Sonny, Whats the amount theyve took our of our farmers It was 16 billion and the year before 12. And said Sonny, We got to make that up, and we made that up. Who would do that Nobody would do that. First of all, nobody else ever had tens of billions of dollars pouring in from China because its always been the other way around. China has taken advantage of our country for decades, decades. And I guarantee you one thing, none of these Democrats, whether its Pocahontas or Sleepy Joe, none of them would be able to do a thing about it, and nobody would ever think of helping the farmers who have been targeted by China. China made 500 billion over the last number of years, on a yearly basis, they steal our intellectual property. So many other things. So now its just different, and now its working the other way, and tariffs are a beautiful thing when you know how to use them, theyre a beautiful thing. And I want China to do well, and I hope they do well, but theyve had now the worst year in 57 years. I wonder why I wonder why And hopefully itll all work out. Well see. Were going to be talking next week. Were talking now. Theyre going to be coming to the United States in two or three weeks, and well see what happens, but unless were going to make a good deal or a fair deal for our country, lets face it, we can not go back to a situation. Were giving hundreds of billions of dollars to China becomes standard fare. Not going to happen, we cant do it, and we have many other countries also, but well worry about them a little bit later. Plenty of others, theyve taken advantage of our country like you wouldnt believe, and Ive been saying this for many years. I was saying this when I was a private citizen. They take our jobs, they make our product, they sell the product into our country with no tax, no nothing. So we end up with closed factories, no jobs, no taxes, no nothing, and these other countries gain. As an example, Mexico, I must say theyve really helped us at the border. The Democrats will not doing anything about these horrible open loopholes, which would be so good. So were doing it a different way, and Mexico is now patrolling with 27,000 troops. Theyve never had two troops steward our border, and you saw the numbers today were down approximately 57%. But our country could fix it so easy if the Democrats would sit with me for 15 minutes, but they dont want to do that because they want to have open borders. They want to have drugs pouring into our country. You have to have a wall and you have to stop it, and when you look at whats happening with human trafficking, and its mostly women, they traffic in women and they pour through our borders. Well, every inch of wall that we put up is vital and were putting up miles and miles, and we intend by next year, at the end of the year, to have anywhere between 400 and 500 miles of wall built, and this is serious wall. This is the real deal. Serious wall. And I want to thank our new Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, for the job hes done and he views it really as a national security threat, and you have to. What can be much more threatening that people that want to pour across our borders, and we have the worst walls, we have the weakest walls in the history of any country You cant do anything to stop them. You have program, catch and release. You catch them and then you have to release them, and theyre suppose to come back to court in the next three, four, fix, six years, and nobody shows up, and Democrats dont want to fix it. So were stopping them, so we dont even have to worry about court. We ended the last administrations cruel war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And for all of these crazy people, but theyre not so crazy, they know what theyre doing, that talk about Russia, Russia, Russia. Russias not too happy about that. Their primary source of income is oil and gas, and now were bigger than Russia, bigger than Saudi Arabia. Were bigger than everybody, and were doing great. So theyre not exactly happy. The Russian Hoax, was a pure hoax, you saw that with Comey the other day. Yet every leading Democrat running for president pledges to ban the energy that drives our economy, and wage an under If you look at whats going on your way of life is under assault by these people. I mean, I go out and sometimes Ill get these huge audiences, and I wish we couldve gotten a large arena than this. We tried. I was even willing to stand out in the rain and get my hair soaking wet, but they said it was a little bit out of your district, and I said, I dont know if it looks good being out of your district. But I was willing to do it, I wouldve taken it. I would have been very proud to have done it. It wouldve shown its my real hair at least. It wouldnt be pretty, but its my hair. May not be great, but I will say its better than most of my friends who are the same age. A lot better. A lot But we had a different location, as you all know, and we said, Lets do this one. Its bigger. And we put screens outside for all of the people. We have screens and loud speakers and everything. Its really amazing whats going on out there, but after years of building up there countries, we are finally building up our country, thats the bottom line. The last administration, with Biden and Obama at the helm, they tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals that ever been negotiated, the Transpacific Partnership. You couldve kissed many of your industries goodbye. TPP wouldve gutted the American auto industry. It wouldve been even worse than NAFTA, and we know how bad NAFTA was. All you have to do, is even to this day, look around at all those empty plants where people moved down and companies moved down to Mexico. Not under the USMCA. We got to get Nancy Pelosi to put it in for a vote, make it bipartisan. Shell have tremendous Democrat support. The farmers want it, the unions want it, the manufacturers want it, and by the way, 600,000 manufacturing jobs in this country, remember You would need a magic wand. You cant do that anymore. Well, we did it, but weve got to get USMCA put up for a vote by the Democrats. But in my first week in office I proudly withdrew from that job destroying TPP catastrophe, and were replacing one of the worst trade deals ever made by any country. You can go back as far as you want, NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. So whatever you do, start talking to your people, we need a vote on the USMCA. Thats United States, Mexico, and Canada, and theyve already voted. They want it and we want it, and its great for the farmers. Its great for everybody. Were also aggressively combating a problem that you have in North Carolina, problem that we have in almost all states, the opioid epidemic. Last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in nearly 31 years. At the center of the American drug crisis is the border crisis. Criminal cartel smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across our souther border, including heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl. 100,000 people a year die from what comes across our souther border, and we can get the Democrats to help us in sealing it even tighter. We got to get them. We got to get them. We got to get them. So if you want to stop the drug smugglers, the human traffickers, the viscous MS13 gang members, and by the way thank you to ICE. These people go into those nests, we call them nets. These are vicious, vicious people. We got into the nests with our ICE people, and for them its another day at the office. There arent too many people in this room that want to do it for a living. Let me see. That guy would. Maybe him, maybe her, right Maybe her. But its a rough job and they get so little praise for the job that they do. So dangerous. These are many killers in those gangs, and were taking them out of our country by the thousands, MS13. And as you know, Democrats even want to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants. As long as Im your president I will never, ever let Democrats take away your healthcare, and give it away free to people that have entered our country illegally. We cant do that. Its a tremendous incentive to come in. Democrats also want to bring in unlimited numbers of foreign refugees from overseas, all at the expense of supporting their own communities. Republicans, no matter what you do, where you are, we want people to obey our laws. You want people that are going to help our country. The Democrat party has never been farther outside of the mainstream. Every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would raid Medicare, force private doctors out of medicine, and lead to the rationing of life saving treatments. And they want to take away your private healthcare, your private insurance. 180 million people will lose with what they want to do. Its a disaster. Its like, did you ever really feel where you dont even have to treat people nicely You dont have any choice, you have to vote for me. I can leave right now. I can say, North Carolina, Ive had it with you. Im leaving right now. And you know what You got to go out and vote. What are you going to do Put one of these crazy people running our country again But its never been so far left. I told a story the other day about a business man I saw, one of the biggest in the country. You probably know his name. Hes hated me for 20 years, and Ive hated him also. Okay Now theyre going to go out tomorrow, Breaking news, Donald Trump hates people. Youre sort of right about that. I never liked this guy, and I see him in the White House, and I say, What are you doing here And he goes, Mr. President. See now he calls me Mr. President. He used to call me something else. Mr. President, Im fighting for your victory. I said, You got to be kidding. He goes, Honestly, youre doing a great job, but also if this radical left gets in theyre going to take away everything, and theyre going to destroy our country. And for the first time I like this guy. My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you. Remember President Obama 28 times, remember 28 times, they counted them and theres much more than that I would imagine, that you can choose your plan, you can choose your doctor. It didnt work out that way, did it Obamacare, and were keeping Obamacare alive. We got rid of the individual mandate, the worst part of Obamacare. Were keeping it and running it as well as it can, but the premiums are too high. The deductibles are through the roof. Its ridiculous, and were coming up with Lindsey Graham and all of the folks, were coming up with a great healthcare plan that if we take back to the house. Thats why Dan and Greg, if we take back the House, if we keep the Senate, and maybe even increase it a little bit, wouldnt be bad, and on the assumption we keep the presidency, youre going to have great healthcare. Thank you. We almost had it. We had a man campaigning for eight years to knock out Obamacare, and when he voted it didnt work out that way, did it We had it, and we would have had it, but were going to end up actually with a better plan. Sometimes through adversity things work out better. Were going to end up with a better plan, you watch. Well always protect patients with pre-existing conditions also. Always, yep, my word. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 51 years. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. Ripping babies straight from the mothers womb, right up to the moment of birth, and if you look at the governor of Virginia, he was even talking about essentially you would say an execution. He was talking after the baby is born, the doctor will talk to the mother and theyll make the decision as to whether or not that baby lives. This is a radical Democrat idea. Thats why Ive asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and socialism. Theyre socialists. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream. Every day theyre making good on the motto, Promise made, promises kept. In fact, we are keeping even more promises by far than we made, or than we promised. So many more. So many more. So many more. You know what we did with respect to people that are very sick or terminally ill, right Right to try its called. I love that name. Right to try. We have some of the greatest doctors in the world, labs in the world, hospitals in the world, and we have incredible medicine thats prohibited from being used until it gets approval, and sometimes that approval can take many years. And I said, Wait a minute, if a person is sick  And theyve been trying to get this for 45 years. I said, If a person is sick, and maybe terminally ill, why arent we letting them try this new technology And so many things are happening, and we did Right to Try. And it wasnt easy, but I was helped by Lindsey and a lot of great people. A lot of great people. All of them helped. Mark helped so much. All of them help. Rick. We have had a tremendous success. We had so many people wanting to help, but it was complicated believe it not because the country didnt want the liability. I said, You know what you do You draw up an agreement taking away liability. They said, Thats a good idea. The insurance companies and the drug companies were very unsure. This has been going on for many years. I got it done. The results have been unbelievable. Right to Try. Things that weve never even talked about were getting done. Maybe one of the biggest things is within about a month, well have close to 180 federal judges, including the public division judges. Including two great new Supreme Court Justices. Justice Neil Gorsuch, and Justice Brett Cavanaugh, who they put through hell. We passed something that theyve wanted to do for half a century. We passed VA Choice. So when your great and honored veterans are waiting in line for three weeks, four weeks, five days, 10 days, two months, they go to a private doctor, we pay for the bill, and they get themselves taken care of, instead of dying, which was happening. And we also passed VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. That means when they treat our veterans, and they wouldnt have done it in primetime I can tell you, but when they treat our sick and trouble veterans badly we can say, Youre fired. Get the heck out. Its called VA Accountability. Thats another one weve been trying, and in all fairness the unions made it very tough. Civil service made it almost impossible. Everyone said, Youre never going to get it done. We got it done. We want to thank the Republican Senate. I want to thank some incredible people in the House of Representatives, and Kevin I want to thank you  people in the House of Representatives. And Kevin, I want to thank you because that was a great job you did on that one. That was a great job, thank you, Kevin McCarthy. Weve received record funding for the US military, 700 billion last year, 716 billion dollars this year, 738 billion dollars  And you know, know Im a big believer in budgets but we have no choice. We had to rebuild our military with all thats going on today with China, with Russia, with radical Islam, with everything thats happening, we had to do something. And you know, budgets are fine, I love budgets and we will get to that, dont worry about it. But we had to rebuild, our military was totally depleted, it was totally depleted. We have beautiful new F-35s, F-18s, new ships, new missiles, new rockets, we have new everything. I came back with Admiral Brown, the United States Coast Guard and some of the other folks, and they were saying that the new Coast Guard cutters  How good a job has the Coast Guard done during these hurricanes And I said, Admiral, how good are the new Coast Guard cutters He said, Theyre the finest in the world, sir. And they had old broken equipment that they had to keep going on a shoestring. They have brand new Coast Guard cutters. We had to do it, we had to do it. Theres always time for the other but we had to do it. Weve rebuilt our military, weve taken care of the great people that work in our military. We gave them a raise, a beautiful raise they were so entitled to. And I also got other NATO members to pay an additional 100 billion dollars over the last year and a half that they werent paying, they were delinquent. Were supposed to protect them and they dont pay, I say you cant do that. You cant do that, you got to pay, NATO. Now were finally making immensely wealthy countries pay the cost of their defense, were negotiating with a lot of them. Think of it, we have these immensely wealthy countries and theyre paying for a fraction of our cost to defend them. How did that happen And do you know what the biggest excuse is when I go to them and Ill say, King, you got to pay, or, Mr. Prime minister, you got to pay, or, Mr. President, youve got to pay, you know Its costing us billions of dollars to protect these wealthy. You know what their biggest thing is Because I cant understand how we did this for so many years, decades, decades  You have been defending all of  I wont mention names because I dont want to embarrass anybody. I dont want to, forget it, some of the wealthiest countries in the world. And when I say, King, President, Prime Minister, Queen, no matter what I say, you know what they say But nobodys ever asked us to do that before, thats the only excuse. Because I say to them, Why would we do this Why are we defending you Youre immensely wealthy, you compete with us on trade. We have lousy trade deals that we are renegotiating many of them and ultimately all of them. Why are we protecting you, Mr. President Well, I dont know, I dont know. But you know what their answer is Because youve always done it. Thats not a great answer. So were taking in billions and billions but Ive got 100 billion dollars and the Secretary General of NATO, Stoltenberg, is my biggest fan. He said, Until President Trump, you had to see the data across the spending was going like this. And ours was going like this, we were defending many countries that treat us very badly on trade and very unfairly. We were defending them and now its changing, around 100 billion dollars, theyre not happy. And then I read where Obama is more popular in Germany than Trump. Hes got to be, Im making people pay their bills, hes got to be. You know, the day that Im more popular than him, Im not doing my job. The big story, they like him more in Europe than they like Trump. I think they should. 100 billion dollars more theyre paying. To protect Americas security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran Nuclear Deal. We paid them 150 billion dollars for that piece of work. I withdrew it and we put sanctions all over the place and theyre a much different country and lets see what happens. But I can tell you theyd like to get back to business because theyre not doing very well. When I came into office, Iran was a real terror. 18 sites of confliction, they were behind every one of them in the Middle East. And who knows, could have been elsewhere. And I said were not going to do it, 150 billion dollars President Obama paid and 1.8 billion in cash. Whoever saw a million dollars piled up as a promotion In hundred dollar bills, its a lot. Now take a million dollars and make it 1.8 billion dollars in cash. Im actually more impressed with that number than 150 billion dollars, you want to know the truth. 1.8 billion dollars in cash and we got taken to the cleaners so I terminated the deal. And I recognized Israels true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem which every president said they would do. And I also approved for Israel the Golan Heights and if you really think about it, I said to people, Whats more important, the Golan Heights or the capital of Jerusalem by moving our embassy there He said, Neither, sir. What youve done in Iran is more important than both of them. I said, You know, I guess youre right when you think about it. So weve done a good job, all of us together, as a movement weve done a great job for Israel. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of North Carolina. You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing thing, you. Its true, its not about me, its about you. Its about your family, your future and the fate of your country. Thats what we did in 2016, they came from the hills and valleys, they came from the cities, they came from all over the place and people were saying, these fakers back there, they were saying, What the hell is happening But I knew it was going to happen because we go out and we see these rallies, the likes of which no one has ever seen before ever, ever, ever in politics, ever in politics. A vote for any Democrat in 2020 and a vote for any Democrat tomorrow in North Carolina is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and a destruction of the American dream. We are entering this campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda and the only positive vision for the people of North Carolina. And Ive said it and I say it loudly and proudly, I dont believe theres been any president or any administration that has done more in 2.5 years then we have as a group in America. When you add it all up, nobodys done what we have. Our first task is a giant victory. Tomorrow, right here in the great state of North Carolina with your support, tomorrow we take the first steps to firing Speaker Pelosi and winning back the House in 2020. We need everybody to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote for Dan Bishop and get out and vote for Greg Murphy, you got to get out tomorrow and vote. Together we will lift millions more from our horrible, horrible situations that have developed over the years. Look at whats happening to Democrat-run cities, every single one of them. We are going to lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. With your help, we will elect for Republicans to Congress to create a safe, modern, fair and lawful system of immigration. We will enact great deals that result in more products probably stamped with the four beautiful words made in the USA, made in the USA. You want made in America, I dont care, what do you like better Made in america or made in the USA Go ahead. Wait, ready You want made in America then made in the USA. What do you like better, made in America, made in the USA Okay, I think we know that answer. So in 2016 we had in my opinion the greatest phrase in the history of politics, make America great again. Now we are within moments hopefully of having, despite what you heard a few weeks ago, where we were heading. And theyre going, Please, please let there be a recession, please. Theyre willing to give up their results because they think it will help them win the election. Theyre not going to win the election. Dont forget, we are doing this and still fighting the unfairness of China and other countries on trade. What happens when that gets fixed and other things get fixed Were setting new records and were fighting trade deals and were fighting military deals that are unfair to our country. Think what happens when it all gets fixed, We have ourselves a country thats going to be so strong. But we had a phrase, make what Make America great again, the best. I think it was maybe the greatest, 2016, but weve done a lot and now theyre very close to setting a new  I think its the 118th time that we will have set a new record with the stock market, right Many, many times, many, many times. I cant be certain that many but its a lot, okay I always have to preface it because therell be headlines, Trump didnt tell the truth. So Ive always got to be extremely cautious. We had the greatest phrase of all time and even the fake news media would agree, make America great again, MAGA country, make America great again. Now we still have a year and a half, little bit less, can you believe it Can you believe it I stood in the White House with the first lady that first night and I said, Wow, look at this. Thats the bedroom of Abraham Lincoln, you have to see this. Its so perfectly done, its so the way it was. We announced it in front of the press and in 2026. And I said, Well, wait a minute, under the normal rules I will be out in 2024 so we may have to go for an extra term. Oh, theyre going crazy. Tomorrow, you will see headlines, Trump wants an extra term, I told you, I told you. He wants an extra term, ladies and gentlemen. We told you, we told you hes a dictator, we told you. No, no, Im only kidding, Im only kidding. But we actually have the World Cup, its the biggest sporting event in the world and we got it. And thats where were working it also with Mexico and Canada to give them some of the games. Weve got a great relationship with the World Cup, its a big deal. Bob Kraft helped me with the New England Patriots people. Tom Brady had a pretty good game the other night, right They have a good a coach, whether you like it or not, and I know you, North Carolina. But how good a coach, in all fairness here, is Coach Belichick How good is he I know you want to be cool but hes pretty good. We have to appreciate genius, we all like genius. But we are going to achieve new breakthroughs in science, medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending within 10 years the AIDS epidemic in America. Thats shocking to hear that but we can do it, were going to do it, definitely. Incredible, the strides that we have made. We will defeat the Democrats to drive up the cost of houses, cars, healthcare and education by liberating Americans from their analysts push for a job killing, soul crushing Washington regulations. As an example, were trying to get the car companies, going to give them a little bit of extra energy and they will be able to build a car that consumers can buy which will be better than the car they make today. And youll save 3,500 dollars, think of that. It will be safer, it will be better, you can save 3,500 dollars, it will be less costly. And were going to try to get that done. And then they were forcing you to buy light bulbs that cost a fortune, so I signed something a couple days ago that gives you the right to continue to use the incandescent light bulbs, I dont know about you, much less expensive lights that are beaming down over us. But you know, somebody told me that as you know, theyre much more expensive bulbs than for what you save. But they said that if the bulb break, its considered almost like the waste site. Its very big, the bulbs, the new bulbs, theyre very dangerous with all of the gases. And I said, Whats the point Well, then he said, Well, Im saying if we continue that production, they can buy whatever they want to buy but it can really save a tremendous amount of money and even have a light thats better. And there is a big danger, in fact they have labels, dont break this bulb. What do you do, youre going to throw it away I promise I wont break it, all the new ones. So you can hopefully buy the new ones but you can buy the old ones too and you can save a lot of money and you could even look better. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America, well be one united nation. Well support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement, thank you, law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way like you. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the words of our national motto, in God we trust, itll stay there. We stand on the shoulders of American patriots who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two world wars wars, defeated fascism and communism, put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world. We are great Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to you. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and Id like to fight a little less with these people but they just dont stop. They just keep coming at you in waves. They are unfortunately not the best people. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, were going to keep on winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, we may have right now the greatest economy in the history of our nation. And ladies and gentlemen of North Carolina, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again, we will. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you."
Freeland,Sep10,2020,"We brought you a lot of car plants, Michigan. We brought you a lot of car plants. You know that, right Long time, its been a long time since you had all these plants being built, but we brought you a lot over the last three and a half years, and were going to bring you a lot more. Thats happening. Hello, Michigan and Im thrilled to be in Freeland with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. Fifty-four days from now, were going to win Michigan, and were going to win four more years in the White House. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring Michigans jobs, outsourcing- We shouldnt be smiling about it, but weve changed it around. Outsourcing Michigans factories, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars and surrendering our childrens future to China and other far away lands. Biden supported every disastrous globalist sellout for over a half a century, including NAFTA, China, and DPP. You know that. Joe Biden surrendered your jobs to China and now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob and youre seeing that every night. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins, the rioters, anarchist, arsonist and flag burners win. But I wouldnt worry about it because hes not winning. I dont think hes winning. This is not the crowd of a person who comes in second place. You do know that. The same thing happened four years ago. It was election eve but by the time I got here, it was late. Some of you are in that audience at one oclock in the morning now election day. We had 32,000 people show up and the reason I went is that I heard that crooked Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama were traveling to Michigan because they heard they had problems. They were supposed to win Michigan, but they did such a lousy job that they had to come and get some votes. They came and I heard about it. They said, Sir, could you do it I hopped in the plane. We landed at 12 oclock in the evening. I started speaking at one oclock in the morning now election day. 32,000 people. She had 500 people. I said, Why are we going to lose Michigan And we didnt. And we didnt. First time in a long time, but now were up in the polls. We just saw polls. Were up in Michigan. I dont know if thats good or bad. I dont know. I dont know if thats good or bad because in all those polls where we were down last time, we won. So maybe were better off being down a little bit. Hello, John James. I see you handsome guy. John James, get out and vote for John. Im going to introduce you in a second John James. What a job youve done. I have to tell you, he took, I saw this group of people that were running, all nice people, three very rich people and one guy that was John James and I saw them all. Right I saw them all and I said, Wait. With the wonderful invention of TiVo, one of the greats, you can play it back. I said, Who was that He said, I dont know, sir. I said, Play it back. I said, That man is going to be a star. It was John James. That was in the Republican primary. After learning about him with his incredible career and helicopter, and hes a great, and actually a great flyer I heard the other day, a great one, a really good one as opposed to those that arent so good, but his incredible background and education at West Point and all of the things he did. I said, This guy and I endorsed him and he went like a rocket ship. Frankly, if he had a little more support, he would have won the last time. This time, I hear youre even, and maybe even ahead, and were going to win with John James. Hes a great guy, but Im going to introduce him in a second. Im running for reelection to keep jobs in Michigan. We have got a lot of  Last year before the China plague came in, we have the China plague. Thank you China very much. Should have never let that happen. They should have never, ever let it happen. They stopped it from going into China, but they didnt stop it from coming out here and coming into the US, in Europe and the rest of the world, 188 countries. But it is what it is and were not happy about it and were going to remember it. Were going to remember it, but we had in Michigan and in the country, the greatest economy in the history of the world, there has never been an economy. Now, were building it again and its being built fast. By the way, its turning out to be John, a super V. No more V. Now its starting out to be a super V, but to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China, because if we win, America wins and thats what its about. If we win, America wins. Not only does Joe Biden want to eliminate your jobs, he wants to eliminate your borders. Hes promised to flood your state with refugees. You know that as well as I do. You see it all the time. From terrorist hotspots around the world, including Syria, Somalia, and Yemen, Bidens pledged to have a 700% increase. He made this deal with crazy Bernie, a 700% increase in the flow of refugees. So, he wants to lift it up by 700%. This is in their manifesto. Hes also pledged to terminate all national security travel bans, overwhelming your state with poorly vetted migrants from jihadist regions. Making matters worse, he would open the flood gates in the middle of a pandemic. By the way, the wall, its over 311 miles long right now doing very well. Doing very well. Make the mic louder, the mic louder. Biden is waging war against the American middle class. I think most of you are not middle class. Youre upper class. Youre the elite. You know the way they talk about the elite, the elite, theyre really elite. I see them. Theyre not elite. Youre the elite. The elite has decided. Boy, have we hurt the elite, havent we now Youre the super elite. The left wants to get rid of me so they can come after you. Its very simple. Over the last three and a half years, weve secured Americas borders, blocked the entry of foreign terrorist, fixed our disastrous trade deals and we have fixed our trade deals good. They are good. In fact, Biden was interviewed today on  There they are. CNN. No, he was just interviewed today. He was interviewed by Jake Tapper who I find to be a nice guy. I dont think he likes me too much, but thats okay. He was interviewed on CNN and they said, Which is better, NAFTA or the USMCA He said, No, no, the USMCA. Tapper goes, What Couldnt believe it. He said USMCA. He made a mistake. From his perspective, he made a mistake because he doesnt know whats going on. Even though hes right, he doesnt know. There were a little surprised to hear that. They gave him a few chances. Lets ask that question again, but we brought back our manufacturing jobs. We rebuilt the awesome power of the US military. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. Now, we are doing it again bigger and better than ever before. Before the end of the year, we will have a safe and effective vaccine and we will defeat the China virus. I have a feeling  By the way, I think the vaccine is going to come very soon, going to come very soon. With it or without it, were rounding the turn. You see whats happening. You see the numbers are plunging. You see how good were doing relative to other countries and other parts of the world, but the fake news doesnt like saying that. They dont like telling you that. Next year, unless you have somebody thats going to quadruple your taxes, raise your taxes, raise up all of those regulations that we cut, next year will be one of the greatest years of the history of our country. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, and two agendas for the future. Theres never been a vision like this. You have sleepy Joe and you have Trump. Sleepy Joe, hes a beauty. Hes a beauty. Hes a beauty. I watched the Democrat debates, right I watched them up there and he was so bad. I said, Theres no way he makes it. Its sad, isnt it The first lady actually came in and one time she watched it and she goes, and shes a nice person. She meant this really, me, I view it differently. But she looked at, she watched the debate and she watched Joe and she said, Darling, its so sad. This was early on. This is the guy Im running against. Its so sad. Darling, its so sad. But we got them. Joe Biden has put forward the most extreme platform and its not him. He doesnt know what platform. He doesnt. Its your radical left people. Its AOC plus three. Its all these people. Bernie. Its Bernie. Its Kamala, the most liberal person in the US Senate. I tell it all the time. She started off her poll numbers at 15, 14, 12, 12. Then she went back up to 12 and a half. Then there was a big plunge right down to the bottom and then she dropped out. She dropped out, but theres never been anything like this. No major party has ever had a candidate thats so extreme in his views. Again, he took the manifesto drawn up by Bernie and the super lips and thats what hes going by, including a massive increase in your taxes and a total assault on your second amendment. On November 3rd, Michigan, you better vote for me. I got you so many damn car plants. Ill tell you what, Ill be so angry at you. I got you a lot of plants. Is that right I mean, have you seen how were doing here All the plants that have been built, are being built and what about the plants that are being expanded They dont want to give you credit for that. They just expanded. I went to Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I say, Prime Minister, you have to start doing something. Hes a great guy. Hell be retiring soon. Hes a great guy, the prime minister of Japan, Abe. I say, Shinzō, Shinzō, you have to do me a favor. Youve got to send car plants over here. Youre sending all those cars. We stupidly dont. Now theyve been building it for a number of years, but you hadnt had a plan built in like 42 years. They were the old plants. And its been amazing whats happened in Michigan. But honestly, its been amazing whats happened in Ohio and North Carolina and South Carolina and Florida and New Hampshire and so many other places. Our country is doing great. We had to take a pause to get rid of the China virus, and we got rid  Were coming around. Were coming around that turn. Im telling you, you watch, next year, better than last year. Its going to be better than last year. Michigan will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, or whether well allow Sleepy Joe to impose 4 trillion in tax hikes, ban American energy, confiscate your guns, shut down the economy, and tell your governor to open up your state. Its all Democrat governors. And I think they do it for political reasons because therell be less activity. Youd be doing even better if you had a governor that knew what the hell she was doing. You got to open it up the state. And also, you have to have a governor because right now Michigans lagging. Great football, great coach, great team. We want a governor, John James, thats going to let Michigan play Big Ten football this year. Youve been seeing a lot of the other schools want to open Big Ten at my suggestion. How about Sleepy Joe He said, Donald Trump is against football. No, no, no. Im the one that says open it up, lets play football. These people practice disinformation like nobody has ever practiced it. Theyre liars. Ill tell you, they lie. But we have a good chance. You have a very good commissioner, and the commissioner is working hard, and hopefully, very soon theyll say youre going to play football. And I hope theyre not leaving Michigan out because its never the same if they do. But you have Maryland, where they have a problem in terms of playing. And the governors have a lot of power over that. They have a lot of power, a lot of say. So lets play Big Ten football, right They want to shut down auto production, delay the vaccine. They want to destroy your suburbs. Look at what Ive done for your suburbs. You know what Ive done. You know what Ive done. Does anybody want to have somebody from Antifa as a member and as a resident of your suburb I dont think so too much. Say, Darling, who moved in next door Oh, its a resident of Antifa. No, thank you. Lets get out of here. Lets get the hell out of here, darling. Lets leave our suburbs. I wish Trump were president. He wouldnt have allowed that to happen. And thats exactly right, I wont allow it to happen. The suburbs are the American dream, and I will tell you, I have protected your suburbs. I got rid of a regulation that played with your zoning and played with other things, where they force projects into the suburbs of our great country. And I got rid of it. They said, Sir, we can amend it and make it less crazy. I said, No, I dont want to amend it. I dont want to do that. I want to get rid of it. Well, sir, why dont we just do a simple amendment It would be  I said, I want to get rid of it. End it. And we ended it. We ended it. I think the people living in the suburbs  which I know very well. I watched Westchester in New York where they were doing things that should never have been done, and its not going to happen to our suburbs. They want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in our schools. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. For the last four years, theyve tried everything to stop us, and they are only getting more desperate by the day. Can you imagine if on September 3rd, they say, Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has been declared the winner. Donald Trump has been declared  At first, theyll go crazy. And then theyll say, Okay, its time now to be reasonable. They will have had it. They will have had it. We were coming together as a nation. Very interesting. Before the plague came in from China, we will coming together. It was success. Somebody said, Whats going to bring you together And it was. We were coming together. I was starting to get calls from Democrats that  Frankly, we didnt speak much. And I was starting to get calls, and then all of a sudden we saw the plague pour in, and we saw what was happening, and it really stopped things. But success was getting very, very close to bringing us all together. And then we had to say, Lets take a time out. We got to fix this mess. And we did, and now were coming back strong, but success brings us together, and it was happening, and then we got that terrible situation happened, and well never forget it. Biden and his party tried to lock law-abiding Americans into their homes while they encourage rioters and vandals rampaging through, in all cases, Democrat-run cities. Republican-run cities are doing very well. I hope you know that. And I hope you know, like in Minneapolis, we were asked to come in, we went in, we took care of that problem in about, what, 30 minutes Unfortunately, they let almost two weeks go by. And if you look at what we just did in Wisconsin, which was so amazing, three days, and we went in. And by the way, the US Marshals went in to get the killer, and that was the end of that. They got the killer, they got the killer. You know what Im talking about. And we were going to go into Seattle. The next day, were all set, all lined up, looking forward to it. We just said, Were doing it. I mean, they actually took over a part of the city, and the mayor said, This is going to be a summer of love, right Where do these people come from But we were all set to go in there, heard we were going in, we informed them were going in, and they sent their police to do it, and we never even had to go in. But we can solve those problems in a matter of literally minutes. Thank you. Dont say that, Ill start to cry, and that wouldnt be good for my image. You dont want to see me cry. Ill start to cry. One of the fake news broadcasters, because this happened the other day, we had a tremendous crowd like this. I mean, we had a tremendous crowd in North Carolina. They started chanting, We love you. We love you. We love you. And its incredible, they said with all the years that theyve been covering presidential elections, theyve never heard that chant that, We love you. No, its very nice. No, theyve never heard it. True. Now theyll say, He misrepresented. 18 years ago, there was a rally held by somebody, and we heard the words from two people that, We love you, sir. Now this is what were dealing with. And by the way, I look out, theres a lot of people that  Look at this. Theres people back there that cant even get in. Thank you, Michigan. Thank you. Its really nice to be with you. As president, I will always support the heroes of law enforcement. I was very honored to receive the endorsement of the Police Officers Association of Michigan. Where are they Where are they Theyre here someplace. Where are they Thank you, fellows. Thats really nice. Ill tell you. Thats an honor. I have to be honest. I got it from Florida, Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, South  But Michigan is Michigan. Thank you. I dont think theres any law enforcement officer that is against us. What is our poll number 99. I know they had 365,000 at one group, and they got a unanimous vote. I said, Thats pretty good. How can you go the other way You people are fantastic, and we love you. Thank you. Thats great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Biden says he wants to protect Black lives, but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of young African American citizens. Thousands. The murder rate in Democrat-run cities like Chicago, Baltimore, New York, so many others is higher than in Afghanistan, yet Biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide. You will have crime like youve never seen before. Youll have crime like youve never seen. Last week, Joe Biden proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal Portland district attorney, who has a policy of releasing rioters, criminals, and violent extremists without charge. Bidens plan  And every time I say Bidens plan, its not his plan, its the people that tell them what theyre going to do, so please understand. I just dont want to say that every time I mention his name. So it should say, The people that control Bidens plan is to appease domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them, to lock them up. If Joe Biden is elected, far left lunatics wont just be running failed Democrat city, theyll be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Supreme Court, and we cant let that happen. No city, town, or suburb will be safe. On November 3rd, your vote will save America. Remember, its the most important election weve ever had. Im joined tonight by some great warriors that have really helped me a lot in Washington with the fake impeachment, the impeachment hoax, the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. Somebody said Russias coming up again. Adam Schiff said, Wed like to find out about  I said, What about China What about other countries Its always Russia. Russia, Russia. Theyre at it again. I want to just thank these guys because these were real warriors for all of us. They love your state, and they love our country. Congressman Jack Bergman. Great job, Jack. John Moolenaar. Thank you, John. Great. Great going, John. Hes a tough cookie. And Tim Walberg. Tim, thank you. Great job. What great people. And I talked about him a little while before, I could talk about him all night. Hes a star. Hes going to be a future star. We have a very much different party than we had four years ago. Were now the party of the workers. Were the party of a lot of different things now, but we werent really considered the party of the workers. Certainly not anymore. Remember this, were the party of Abraham Lincoln. A lot of people forget that. Honestly. Remember when they used to say, he doesnt act presidential And I used to say, Its so easy to be presidential. Id only have about 10 or 15 people here. Youd be bored. But remember I used to do that But Id always say, I can be more presidential than any president in our history, except for the possibility of Abraham Lincoln when he wears his hat. Tough to beat. Thats tough to beat, John James. But seriously, if you want to be well-represented  Your current Senator, I dont even know this guy. I dont even know this guy. Nobody does. They dont know who he is. They dont even know. He comes into the office, I say, Who is that guy I know every Senator. Democrat, Republican. I dont know this guy. I know your other Senator. I can tell by her hair. Shes got interesting hair. But that was Johns first crack. He learned a lot. And frankly, and I mean this, if he had more support from the Republican Party, he wouldve won that race. He wouldve. But this guy Peters, right Peters. I say, Whos Peters Nobody knows him. He doesnt do anything. I mean, look, were going to end this, but I have to tell you, John James can be so great. He loves our country. Hes been educated at the highest level. He was always the top at everything hes ever done. And this is what he has. And Ill be honest with you, John. I think I can tell this story. John and I were thinking about John. I was thinking about John more than myself because I know talent. And I said, John, you can run for a certain House seat, right And youre guaranteed to win. You can run for another House seat. Itll be a tough race, but youre going to win. Or you can have a tough race against somebody that nobody ever heard of. Its like a habit that they press that particular trigger, but thats a tough race. So you can be an absolute Congressman, or you can take a shot at this one. He said, Sir, I can do more in the Senate than I can do in the House. And that was his decision. Right Took a lot of guts. So John, Im with you. You have my total and complete endorsement. You have everything I can do. Everything I can do, we will do for you. And I really believe youre going to make it. Youre running against somebody that is just ridiculous, folks. Its ridiculous. Dont do it. Also with us are some other great candidates and people that are going to do a tremendous job, helping our Congressman. Paul Junge. Wheres Paul Junge Paul, thank you. Good luck. I heard youre doing well, Paul. Paul Junge. Lisa McClain. Lisa Great job. Its going well. And Eric Essahki. Thank you, Eric. Good luck. Good luck. Were going to be out here helping you, too. Were going to be out here. I hope John doesnt even need help, but were going to help John, too. Were going to help all of you. All right Were going to be doing it. Thank you. Also with you is RNC Chairwoman. She was the head of the whole state, and she kept calling me back, back. Sir, one more speech, youre going to win Michigan. Hadnt been won in decades. One more speech, sir, youre going to win Michigan. I said, All right. Ron, Im coming in one more time, but thats it. I said, That woman is the most aggressive person Ive ever met. She said, Im telling you, sir, one more speech. I said, All right, Ill do it one more time, but thats it. About a day after I got back, I said, I just got back from Michigan. It was wonderful. I get a call from Ronna McDaniel, and she goes, Sir, could you come in tomorrow for another speech Well, whatever happens, she is the one that got me here at midnight on  She is. So when it came time to picking the head of the RNC, as president, you have a couple of things to say about it, right I said, Whos that woman that kept getting me back to Michigan Boy oh boy, shell be great. Ronna McDaniel. And somebodys doing a fantastic job and tells us were really pretty far ahead. Maybe way ahead. They had a poll. I think it was a Gallup poll. They said 62% of the people are lying about their poll. Now, theyre only lying having to do with my  And I dont know if Im supposed to be insulted by that or not, but well take it. But we could have a very big win. And look, no president has done for Michigan what President Trump has done for Michigan. And youre going to remember that. And Im going to remember Michigan. Michigan GOP Chair Laura Cox. Great. Thank you. Great job. Great job. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks, Laura. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. 47 years of bad votes. After the last administration nearly killed the US auto industry, I saved the US auto industry. Joe Biden supported the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for American auto jobs. I withdrew from the TPP my first week in office. That was so easy. That was so easy. You wouldnt have been making cars. You wouldve been buying cars from foreign lands. We have enough of that. Biden supported the horrendous South Korea deal that wouldve wiped out US production of the pickup truck, which is the most  The pickup truck is the most profitable thing the auto industry makes. You know why We have something called the Chicken Tax. Does anyone know what Im talking about The Chicken Tax. Its a tariff of 25%, and it keeps other countries out of here, and it expired, and South Korea didnt want to do it, but they did it. We got it right back, and we put it on for a long time, and now youre making  But remember this, go check it out. The Chicken Tax. Ill tell you why someday at another meeting why they call it that. Maybe you dont want to know about it. But were keeping those small trucks, and were keeping our whole industry good. And were expanding our autos now, our cars, and were doing a great job of it, and I want to thank everybody. Doing a great job. And by the way, many other things in Michigan. Biden supported the outrageous fuel economy standards that have hammered the auto industry, and I reversed that rule. I actually reversed it, and it helped millions of families be able to afford a car. The United States lost 500 auto and auto parts factories under the Obama-Biden disaster. Before the virus, my administration added over 200 new auto and auto parts plants. How about 200 I didnt know that. 200. 200. I thought it was a little less than that. Wait, I want to see that again. 200. Its   than that. Wait, I want to see that again, 200. It says 200. Do you believable it Thats a lot. You know, I have a choice between teleprompter and freelance. I hate to say, the freelance is always a hell of a lot better, but  If you remember, and you remember well, I actually got elected because of freelance. We didnt have teleprompters. There were no teleprompters. But think of that, 200, were talking about 200 plants. I thought it was a much lower number. I thought you should put me in an office based on a much lower number. At 200, you have no choice. Yesterday, Biden was in Michigan. He said, I better get out of the basement. This guy is starting to do very well lying about his lifetime of cold hearted globalist betrayals. Biden championed NAFTA, perhaps the worst trade deal in the history of our country. He continued to embrace and promote NAFTA for decades. I told you, he just said it was not as good as the deal I made. I cant believe, oh theyre giving him hell tonight. Theyre giving him hell. What did you say that for Boy oh boy. Yeah, hiding. Joe Hiden. Look, this doesnt sound nice. Ill say it, and theyll criticize for it, you watch. But I have the distinct pleasure of running against the worst presidential candidate in the history of presidential politics. I really believe that. I do. Can you imagine if I lost to him Id have to say I lost to the worst candidate ever put up. Dont do that to me, Michigan. Dont do that. Biden supported Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization, which, by the way, was a disaster. China was flatlining for years and years and decades and it got into this World Trade Organization with all sorts of advantages. Just a terrible, terrible situation took place. Thats when China became a big, powerful economic power. But, if you look at the numbers just before the plague, now, the numbers are different, we were going up, up, up, we were beating them like a drum. They werent even close. We were gaining, gaining, gaining. We were number one by far. You know, for years Ive heard that in 2019, China was going to surpass us. Well, in 2019, we gained a lot on them. We were doing great. We were doing great and well be doing even better next year, you watch. Yesterday it was revealed that a fund partly owned by Joe Bidens son, wheres Hunter See his first name, I now name  His first name is where. Wheres Hunter He must be a brilliant guy because with no experience hes taken more money from more countries. He had no job and then he became rich. But wheres Hunter who facilitated the sale of a Michigan automotive company to a leading Chinese military defense contractor Does anyone know that Chinas military got yet another piece of American manufacturing, Mike and the Biden family made a lot of money on it. It was a lot of money. What about Ukraine He got 183,000 a month, 3 million upfront and he had no experience with energy, working for an energy company, by the way. Whats your experience, Hunter Whats your experience with energy I dont have any. Okay. Well pay you 183,000 a month and I will give you an upfront payment, Hunter, of 3 million. Will that be satisfactory He goes, Yes. Ill take it. Would anybody here not take that deal Anybody Please raise your head. This is one guy, right, you must be a pretty rich guy. If Bidens elected, China will own America. Washington vultures like Biden and others ripped apart entire towns all across your state. Michigan lost half of all manufacturing jobs after the trade deals that Biden supported. By the way, I dont know if anybody  But does anybody remember like 12 years ago Long before I thought about running for president, when I enjoyed my life, I had the greatest life. Where would we like to go Lets go to Monte-Carlo this weekend. Lets go. No, I had a great life, but I was honored. I was doing very well. I was honored in Michigan. Does anybody know that I was given man of the year award by somebody I came in and I spent like 45 minutes talking about how youve been ripped off, how all your auto companies are leaving and going to Mexico and, by the way, to Canada too. But how theyre all leaving and going to Mexico and Canada. I spent the whole time talking about it. At the end I felt embarrassed, I said, I hope I havent insulted the state too much, but why do you let this happen I stopped it. I stopped. It wont be happening. It wont be happening. Its not going to happen anymore. Biden took a sledgehammer to your state earlier this year, I kept my promise to Michigan workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare that everybody said was impossible to end, and when we signed that brand new US- Mexico-Canada agreement into law. The USMCA includes powerful wage protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan. Now they have a tremendous disincentive to leave Michigan, fire all of our workers, go to Mexico or Canada, make the car or the product, send it in here without tariffs. We end up with closed factories, no job and no taxes. Thats not happening anymore. Thats not happening anymore. But do you remember how bad it was just before I took office It was like an avalanche of companies leaving our country. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to Chinas rampant theft of Michigan jobs. Biden has vowed to remove these tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging. Just so you know, Chinas paying us tens of billions of dollars a month. Before me, China never paid anything. They didnt pay us 25 cents. You know what I did with some of that money I gave it to our farmers. I dont know if we have a lot, do we have farmers here We have farmers. Raise your hands farmers. Thats not bad No, I gave 28 billion to our farmers because they were targeted by China. They were targeted. They said, You know  and thats what they did in the past to other presidents. They said, If you do this, were going to stop doing business with your farmers and youre not going to be able to get any votes and youre going to lose the Midwest and all of that. I said, You know what I do, whatever you want. Then I went to Sonny Perdue, Secretary Of Agriculture, a great guy, I said, Sonny, How much are they being targeted for Sir, 12 billion the first year, two years, three years ago, and then 16 billion, a total of 28 billion. I said, Thats okay. Were putting tariffs on everything they send into our country, 25%. Was going to raise it to 50%. Also, 10% at 12%, all different tariffs. We took in billions and billions, and I said, You know what were going to do Were going to take, of that, the 12 and the 16, 28 billion and were going to give it to our farmers who were targeted, and our farmers are doing great. Thats what we did. Do you think Joe Biden would do that He wouldnt have a clue. Hillary wouldnt have had a clue. Crazy Bernie wouldnt have, nobody would add a clue on that one. By the way, we had tens of billions of dollars left over. You know what I did with that We gave it to the US Treasury, right smack into the heart of the US Treasury. And were still getting those big tariffs. Even though we made a trade deal with China. I said, No, you got to leave the tariffs on. A lot of people didnt know it. Schumer went, Well, I dont like to do  First of all, he didnt like tariffs, and then all of a sudden he loves it. But when I made the deal with China, I left the tariffs on 25% and some different amounts. When I left tariffs largely on and nobody could believe it. I said to Schumer, What do you think of the deal I dont like it because you got rid of the tariffs. I said, No, we left the tariffs on. This is what it is. No matter how you do it, no matter how good the deal, theyll say, Its no good, because they dont love the country. They dont love the country. Remember that. Joe Bidens agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA. Thats a nice plane. Somebody said to me, Your planes just as nice as that. I said, No, its not. Thats Air Force One. Thats the nicest. Always, thats the nicest. I also authorize millions of dollars to save Michigan Soo Locks, and forget all the problems they had. For years and years, they fought over the money to do it. We got 300 million to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and we have done a job on the Soo Locks. They were rotting you. Werent going to have anything come through the Soo Locks. Its all done. That deal is all done. Its all done. Right Thank you. Thank you. Where are my guys there Good job. Right. Even though youre law enforcement, thats a good job, right Two months ago, I also issued a major disaster declaration in response to the catastrophic flooding caused by the failure of the Edenville dam. Where are the people from Edenville Yeah, good. No, that was a terrible thing and theyre working very hard right now. Were providing more than 43 million in federal funds to help homeowners, businesses and communities in central Michigan to recover from that catastrophe. Thank you. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, weve achieved the most secure border in American history. Weve ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and weve deported over 20,000 vicious gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens. As I said, weve already built over 310 miles of border wall. Its all going to be finished very quickly. Were averaging about 10 new, brand new, beautiful miles every single week. Itll be finished very short. Weve invested 2.5 trillion in the US military. All made in the USA, by the way. All made in the USA. You know, with the fake news today, I said, And we have systems and missiles and rockets and military and tech. We have systems that youve never even seen before. President Xi has nothing like it. Putin has nothing like it. Nobody has anything like what we have. They said, Is he giving away military information No, Im saying, We have the greatest weapons in the world. Thats what Im saying. They said, He may be giving away classified information. You dont have to worry about it. These people are sick. Never speak well about our technology because youre giving away classified information. Now, I just want to let people know, we have the greatest systems, the greatest equipment and the greatest people anywhere in the world. Theres nobody like the US military. We have the most powerful military in the world. When I took it over, it was depleted. It was in trouble and was exhausted from these ridiculous, endless wars that lasts 19 and 20 years, and you know, those soldiers are starting to come home very big. You know that right. We passed the MISSION Act, we call it VA Choice and VA Accountability. We hold people accountable if they dont treat our vets good, youre fired. Get out. Youre fine. We did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. Thats true. We did more. That sort of has a nice ring to it. Right Think of it. We did more and its true. Just take a look, Space Force, by itself, that would be a major achievement, and with us, we did so many things, so many things. But we did more in 47 months than he did in 47 years. Its true. Its true. A lot of what I did is destroy some of the horrible things that they did, including regulations all over the place. I withdrew from the last administrations disastrous Iran nuclear deal. We paid 150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash. We ought to speak to law enforcement about that. How do we send 1.8 billion in cash In cash You guys ought to take a look at that please. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Every president said they were going to do that and none of them did it, for decades and decades, they all said. I tell this story, it was a hard thing to get done. It was easy to talk about in the campaign, Were going to open up the embassy in Jerusalem. Were going to make it. It becomes automatically the capital of Israel. Everybody said it for very, very many decades, for decades, many presidents. But I realize now why it was an effort because as soon as I got in, I was lobbied by everybody, Please dont do it. Dont do it. Dont make the capital of Israel Jerusalem. Dont move your embassy. So went on and on. Then I said, Lets do it anyway. Its true. And the word got out. The word got out that I was going to do it, and I was called by every king and every queen and every prime minister and every  Everybody was calling me, Please sir, dont do it. Please. So I did what we sometimes will do in business, I told them  When a king calls, when somebody calls, an Emir, when somebody calls, tell them, Ill call them back in a few days. Im sorry, sir. He wont be able to speak right now, hell call you back on Wednesday. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. On Tuesday, I announced that Im doing it. Then I got on the phone with 18 different companies. I go, Hey, how you doing You called, Im just returning your call. Oh, its too late, sir. We called about Israel. Its too late. I said, Gee, Im sorry. I wish you got to me a little bit sooner. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in Middle East peace in decades. And by the way, on Wednesday, I believe of next week, Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and as you know, the country, a very powerful, very respected country with a great leader, the UAE, is coming to the White House and were going to sign an agreement that hasnt been signed in many decades. Its peace and its recognition of Israel and all of the things, nobody thought it could be done. Its an amazing thing. I dont say this out of ego, but I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Now, I have to tell you, thats sort of a big thing and the networks and most of the news didnt cover it. Could you imagine When Obama came to office, they said, Were going to give him the Nobel Peace Prize. He actually said, What did I do I didnt do anything. He didnt do anything for eight years, frankly. But he said, What did I do They gave it to them in a matter of weeks, right Weeks. With us, weve done so much. We have done so much on so many different fronts. Remember North Korea Remember They were going to be at war with North Korea. Wheres the war Wheres the war Wheres the war And we have a good relationship with Kim Jong-un. Who knows what happens All I know is, were not in war and thats okay. They said, But he gave away so much. I said, I gave away nothing. No, he gave away so much. When I said, What did they give away You know what they said Uh, we dont know. I said, Heres what I gave away, I gave away nothing. They said, Oh, but you agreed to meet. Oh, I see. I agreed to meet. So now theyre saying, I agreed to meet, it was such a big deal. Instead of being in a war, I think agreeing to meet is okay, right And we did. Hes a different kind of a guy and hes a smart guy, a very smart guy. We get along. Getting along with foreign powers is not a bad thing. Were trying to teach that to the media and these idiots that ran our government for so many years. These fools. These fools. You know, you got nuclear weapons, you got big armies, big navies, He gets along with Putin. Thats a terrible thing. No, its a good thing. If I get along, thats good. He likes me. I like him. Not so bad. He gets along with Kim Jong-un.  Not so bad. He gets along with Kim Jong-Un. Thats a terrible thing. No, its a good thing. Im trying to convince him. Its okay. Its okay not to go to war. Its really okay. He gets along with President Xi, he gets along with Prime Minister Abe. He gets along with a lot of people, and its okay. Thats a good thing. Its really hard. These stupid people that have been running this operation for 30, 40 years, and they come out against me, and all they did was stick us in these endless wars. Were fighting for sand and blood. Sand and blood. Syria, what do you get out of it You get sand, you get blood, you get injuries, you get death. These people dont know what the hell theyre doing and its one of the reasons I got elected, I can tell you that. We dont like his foreign policy. And this is said by one of the guys that got us into the war in Iraq, got us into the Middle East. So, its  Were doing a great job. Were doing a great job for you. Were doing a great job for Michigan. Just to finish in the Middle East, we killed the founder and leader of Isis, Al-Baghdadi. And by the way, were pulling back and were doing everything so beautifully. If we do get into war, we win the war. We dont fight for nothing. We fought for nothing. We dont ever want to have war but if there is a war, nobodys going to even come close to being able to beat us. And we wont be depleted from fighting in all these ridiculous locations all over the globe. You people know that a lot better than the idiots in Washington that has represented us for 35 years. We took out the worlds number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops, Qasem Soleimani is dead. We kept America out of new wars and were bringing our troops back home, and theyre coming home very rapidly. You see that. Sleepy Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War. He supported the Defense Sequester that gutted our military, destroyed our military, set us back so many years. I got rid of it immediately. He opposed the mission to take out Osama Bin Laden. He was against it. Everything he did, he was wrong on as said by Gates, you know Secretary of Defense, Secretary of everything. He was sort of like  He had more jobs than any human being Ive ever seen. But he said, Everything, everything that Biden was for was wrong. He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of Isis. He was unable to do anything with Isis. as he came to the White House two weeks ago. And we cheered as we looked at all of the success that weve had but he really oversaw the rise of China as a positive development. Remember, he said, No, its a positive development for America and for the world. Hes been in Washington for 47 years now. Hes all of a sudden going to change Hes going to change Hes not going to change. Dont forget, he was in Washington in his primetime, which was never considered great, and now its no longer primetime. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died from the China plague. Biden was willing to sacrifice American lives on the altar of open borders. And now Joe Biden is once again hurting innocent people with his dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, putting millions of lives around the world at risk. And the only reason hes doing that is he knows were right next to having a vaccine. So, he wants to belittle the vaccine because he doesnt want us to get credit plant, who converted their factory to produce tens of thousands of ventilators, after we invoked the Defense Production Act, and theyve done a fantastic job. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator any time in our whole country. They needed a ventilator, we had nothing. We were left, bare cupboards. I always say the cupboards were bare. Were delivering lifesaving therapies, and have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates anywhere of any country in the world. Europes excess mortality rate is 24% higher than the rate in the United States. You dont hear that from the fake news. Hey, America will prevail over the China virus, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Thats it. Were doing very well. As the British government advised the British people in the face of World War II, Keep calm and carry on. Thats what I did. This whack job that wrote the book, he said, Well, Trump knew a little bit. They wanted me to come out and scream, People are dying, were dying. No, no, we did it just the right way. We have to be calm. We dont want to be crazed lunatics. We have to lead. When Hitler was bombing, I dont know if you know this, when Hitler was bombing London, Churchill, great leader, would oftentimes go to a roof in London and speak, and he always spoke with calmness. He said, We have to show calmness. No, we did it the right way and weve done a job like nobody. All of those great generals, all of those great admirals, our great vice president, Mike Pence, they did a fantastic job. Our doctors, and they dont get any credit because they want to discredit us as much as possible because they want it to carry over to November 3rd, but weve done a fantastic job. I think weve probably done the best job of any country, certainly of any major country anywhere in the world on the pandemic. Through our historic relief programs, weve saved more than 1.6 million Michigan jobs, and over 128,000 Michigan businesses. Michigan has already gained and regained more than half of the jobs that it lost, and if your state was ever allowed to safely reopen by your governor who doesnt have a clue. Shes like Joe. You would have regained far more than that. Open up your state, Madam Governor, open up your state. Lets go. Just like crazy Nancy Pelosi, your governor is a liberal hypocrite who lives by a different set of rules. Her husband was caught trying to put his boat in the water on Memorial Day weekend while she was ordering the people of Michigan to stay in their homes, and forcing businesses into bankruptcy left and right. The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy this great opportunity that were having right now. He would impose job destroying regulations that would demolish the auto industry. You know, on regulations, it took, in many cases, 18, 19, 20 years to get a roadway or a highway approved. We have it down now to two years. Were trying to get it down to one year, and it may get disapproved for environmental or safety reasons, but were going to know about it very fast. No more 20 year approvals or disapprovals. He wants to force you to provide free government healthcare to illegal aliens. He will destroy your social security. He will destroy your protections for pre-existing conditions, and we will save social security. Remember they said last time Oh, Trump is going to destroy social security. Well, its now four years, we havent touched it. Weve protected it, and thats going to remain that way. Biden opposes school choice and has stated that if hes elected, charter schools, so important, are gone. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans, instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we have been through, we are changing Washington. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in Michigan. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring incomes and record prosperity, and thats already happening. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities, and we will ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. And youre lucky Im here because youre Second Amendment would be gone if I wasnt. And they didnt touch it. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep out people, keep them out of these horrible, horrible situations where they hurt our country, they hurt the people of our country, and were also going to be staying out of the endless ridiculous foreign wars in countries that youve never even heard of. We will build the most powerful missile and cyber defense. Weve already got it, pretty much. And we will maintain peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require the biggest thing that nobody even knows about and its all signed and it goes into effect on January 1st. You better make sure I win. Can you imagine This is going to be the biggest thing and nobody understands what it is. Youll figure it out. Price transparency. Did they fight me on that one. January 1st. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs at a level like youve never seen before. Ive already signed it. Favored Nations. The drug companies are not happy, I will tell you. Just, all you have to do is take a look at all the ads theyre running against me. Favored Nations, where we pay whatever the lowest is in the world, we pay that number. We will protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect our patients. We will always our people. We will your pre-existing conditions, as I said. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will restore patriotic education, you know what I mean by that, and we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust. And I dont know if you saw it, but during the Democrat National Convention and Caucus, they took twice, I thought I was sort of, maybe they made a mistake, you saw that, they took the word God out of the Pledge of Allegiance twice. And then they said, Oh, well maybe it was a mistake. It wasnt a mistake. Thats where theyre coming from. Dont be foolish. Thats where theyre coming from and theres nothing that Sleepy Joe Biden can do about it. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for Michigan. So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and your coworkers, and get out and vote. So important. From Grand Rapids to Saginaw, from Kalamazoo to Mackinac, and from Flint to right here in Freeland, we stand on the shoulders of generations of Michigan patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line. Its the place where General Motors, Chrysler and Kellogg revolutionized entire industries. Michigan, well, you know this one, right Michigan gave us Motown, right Thats right. Thats right, Motown. We love Motown. Michigan gave us Motown, gave us Motown, gave us the Mustang and the unrivaled might of the American Midwest. This is the state where tough, strong and determined workers made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together, we will be taking back our country, well be taking it back from people that dont love our country and that take back is almost complete. We have to win on November 3rd. Were returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, we are going to keep on winning. Vote for John James. John James. We need John James. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God, and together, with the incredible people of Michigan, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Michigan. We love you, Michigan. Thank you. Thank you."
Dallas,Oct17,2019,"Thank you. Thank you very much. Hello Dallas. Its great to be with you tonight. Thank you. I am thrilled to be here deep in the heart of Texas where we just opened a beautiful new Louie Vuitton plant. Im with the freedom loving Patriots of the lone star state. I love it. There has never been a better time to be a proud Texan and theres never a better time to be a proud American. There never has. Never has. I came from a small town, Alvarado, Texas where we celebrated the incredible revival of American manufacturing and we opened up some beautiful places. Ill tell you, this place is doing great and created in a very short period of time an extra 1000 jobs for Texas. Since my election, weve created 775,000 new jobs across your state including 70,000 Texas manufacturing jobs. They said those jobs had disappeared, didnt they Huh Hey man, our country is once again living by two simple rules, buy American and hire American. The economy is booming. Our people are prospering. Our country is thriving and our nation is stronger than ever before. But the more America achieves, the more hateful and enraged these crazy Democrats become. Crazy. Theyre crazy. Theyre crazy. At stake in this fight is their survival of American democracy itself. Dont kid yourself. Thats what they want. They are destroying this country but we will never let it happen. Not even close. For three straight years, radical Democrats have been drawing to overthrow the results of a great, great election. Maybe, maybe the greatest election in the history of our country. They want to oppose an extreme agenda. They cannot pass it and they cannot win it at the ballot box. Theyre not going to win. The not even going to get  they wont come close in 2020. They know it. They know it. Theyre not going to win it. They say, lets see. Whats another idea Whats another idea How do we win this election You know, I really dont believe anymore that they love our country. I dont believe it. Crazy Nancy. Think of that. That crazy Nancy. She is crazy. And shifty Schiff. How about this guy He makes up my conversation, which was perfect. He makes up my conversation. He sees what I said. It doesnt play well because it was perfect. So he made up a totally false conversation with the Ukrainian president and we caught him cold. Everybody knew it anyway. See, we did one thing. You always have to do the unexpected. They never thought Id released the conversation with the Ukrainian president. I want to get him before Congress and I want to see what he has to say. You know, they say he has immunity. Why would you have immunity for outright fraud Why do you have immunity Why Hes a fraud. Were fighting a campaign against leftist, socialist, and globalists who want to return to reckless wars, open borders, rampant crime, and totally disastrous one way trade deals. Were changing that one around very quickly. They believe America is the worlds piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy, military and defense of every other nation in the world but our own. Its not happening anymore. Our political opposition made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens. And you know thats whats been happening. And thats why 2016 was so important. And thats why 2020, I can never say its more important, but you know its like the roots of a tree. You plant the baby tree, its got to catch, get that extra time. Well have more tax cuts. Well have even  Ill tell you what, we have rebuilt our military. What weve done has never been done before. The do nothing democrats have betrayed our country and that great betrayal is over. We are finally again, and weve been doing it now for almost three years. Can you believe weve been doing this for three years Can you believe it Ive been a politician for three years. I cant believe that. I never thought Id be called a politician. I dont like it. But it is what it is. But were finally again putting America first. The radical Democrats want to destroy America as we know it. They want to indoctrinate our children and teach them that America is a sinful, wicked nation. You see that happening all the time. And I know it from personal experience. What they want to teach your kids, not good. They come home, mommy, daddy, this is what I learned. And youre going, oh no, dont tell me. Lets get them into another school fast. They want to disarm law abiding citizens. They want to take your guns away. They want to install far left judges to shred our constitution. Its not happening. They want to tear down symbols of faith and drive Christians and religious believers from the public square. They want to silence your voices on social media and they want the government to censor, muzzle, and shut down conservative voices. You know that. If they didnt hate our country, they wouldnt be doing this to our country. They wouldnt be doing it because they know better. They know better. As an example, were building a great wall along the Southern border and its going up rapidly. Going up. And you know, five years ago almost every one of them wanted a wall until I came along and I said, were going to build a great wall because they could never get it done. Then they stopped the funding. They made it almost impossible. Few people wouldve been able to do what we did, but we got it from here and we got it from there and we got it from all over the place and were building that sucker right now and its having a tremendous effect already. Not easy. Highest level. Everything we said it would be, its moving rapidly. Although the fake news back there, they dont want to talk about it. They dont want to talk about it. Look at all those cameras. You believe it. Look at all those red lights. Dont worry. I wont say anything bad about your network because a lot of times I get ready to do a number of these phony networks and you know, you see those red lights go off, off, off, off. They dont want their viewers to see it, but thats okay. Im not going to say it tonight. Im going to say youre legitimate media. I dont actually mean that. But you look at that. But look at all those cameras. You know thats like the Academy Awards used to be before it failed. You know why it failed You know why it failed Because they came after us. Thats why it failed. It failed because they had stupid people saying horrible things about us. Stupid. stupid people. They are stupid people and their ratings have dropped like a rocket. I love seeing it. Im telling you. Love it. But no matter how hard they try, they will fail because the people of Texas and the people of America will never surrender our freedom to those people right there. We will stand strong for family, faith, God, and for country. Last week, a very dumb Democrat candidate for president, thats the end of him in this state, pledged to revoke the tax exempt status of many churches and religious charities. By the way, that was after a few weeks ago. He said, excuse me, were going to take your guns away. That doesnt work well with me. I called him right. Remember the flailing arms Nobody noticed it. I noticed it. The flailer. You remember he was flailing all over the place. I said why is this guy hot John Cornyns going to win so easily. Just like Ted Cruz won. Hes going to win no matter what happens. But John Cornyn is not talking about Beto anymore because Beto, in a few short weeks got rid of guns and got rid of religion. Those are not two good things in Texas to get rid of. I will never allow the federal government to be used to punish Americans for their religious beliefs. I will never allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon, except in the case of myself where they use it against me. The radical left tolerates no dissent. It permits no opposition. It accepts no compromise. These people are crazy. And it has absolutely no respect for the will of the American people. First it was the Russia hoax. Then it was the smearing which continues, that disgraceful, disgusting smearing of a fine man, Justice Kavanaugh. And now they continue the outrageous impeachment witch hunt with nothing. With nothing. They come after me, but what theyre really doing is theyre coming after the Republican party and what theyre really, really doing is theyre coming after and fighting you. And we never lose. Im fighting for everyone who believes in the values, traditions, and principles that have made our nation the greatest in the history of the world. And I have to say this, we are far greater now than ever before. You go back four years, you go back seven, six, eight, even you go back into another administration, you go back 10 and 12 years, where were you compared to where you are right now We must hold the Democrats accountable for their lies and their corruption. They are corrupt people. And we must show and vote and we have to go out and we have to win this election coming up. Its going to be a landslide and we have to make it a landslide. Todays do nothing democrats, they dont do anything. Wheres the USMCA Everybody wants it. The Democrats even want it and crazy Nancy wont let anybody vote on it. Shes nuts. Todays Democrats believe anyone who opposes them must be crushed. Its not just like, lets win. You know, I have to say this. The Republicans said, Im not sure I like this because my life hasnt been this way, but the Republicans play a much softer game. They really do. When all of our stars, and we have great stars, when they went to our speaker of the house at the time and they asked for subpoenas, oh, lets take it easy. Lets  okay. I mean, I get that too. She hands them out like its cookies. Here. Subpoena. I heard a commentator who happens to be standing right there the other day. Doesnt like us at all. But said, Ive never seen anyone hand out so many subpoenas. I have people getting subpoenas I never heard of. I said, who are those people Never saw anything like it. Its a disgrace what theyre doing to our country. We became, because of what they do, not the Republicans and not what weve done because what theyve done and what they see. When people come to my office, which is now the oval office, which is your office too. Presidents, Prime Ministers, Kings, Queens. I hate to say it. Sometimes dictators, they just dont like to go by that title. They say, sir, congratulations sir on what youve done. Congratulations on what youve done. Its incredible. Your economy is the greatest on earth. And let me tell you it, if my crooked opponent would have won the election right now China would be by far the number one nation from an economic standpoint in the world. Weve gone up trillions of dollars. Theyve gone down trillions of dollars, and we are so far number one, so far that theyll never catch us if we are smart right here. But the do nothing Democrats believe anyone who opposes them has to be crushed. They dont want to just beat them. They dont want to just beat him. These are sick people. They want to crush these people. The anger, the hatred, and that any lie or crime or corruption is justified so Schiff gets up and makes up my statement. He makes it up 100% and then he said he didnt speak to the whistle blower. No, we didnt see the whistleblower. And what about the whistleblower The whistleblower got it all wrong. Whos the whistleblower Whos the whistleblower Who is the whistleblower We have to know. Is the whistleblower a spy And who is the IG that did this All he had to do is look at the tape or look at what they wrote down, the transcribed version of the phone call. Compare that to the whistle blowers account and you see it had nothing to do with it. So why does the IG allow a thing like this to happen to our country Why Why Got a lot of bad people out there, but one by one were advancing. One by one. Just look at the terrible foreign corruption of the Bidens. I hate to talk about him. You know why I dont think the guys got a chance. Sleepy Joe. I dont think hes got it. I dont see it. I dont know. Ive got these great, brilliant senators over here. I have all these congressmen over here. Fellows I dont think he has a chance. Id like him to. Id like him to. You know I thought Pocahontas was gone, left in embers. You got to give her credit. Those embers, they kept going, going, going. Now it looks like shes doing better. But I dont think Joe has a chance. But did you see the other night where CNN, in a totally unsubstantiated statement, the president said this about you. Were so sorry he said that. His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China. These were not the same Chinese people I just dealt with. I will tell you that. But Joe Biden was in charge of Ukraine policy while his son with absolutely no energy experience just got thrown out of the Navy like a dog, was paid massive sums of money by a Ukrainian energy company. You know thats called Its called a payoff, folks. He didnt no energy at all, knew nothing about energy. They hired him, paying him massive amounts of money, much more than the 50,000 a month you heard about. Thats a lot. Thats a lot. But much more. Joe Biden made them go out and fire the prosecutor on tape. But they dont want to show the tape. I had to put it up on my social media site. They dont want to show the tape where he was bragging. Youre not going to get this money unless they get rid of  and boom, they got rid of the prosecutor. He was investigating the son and the sons company. Got rid of him. Now thats what you call quid pro quo. While these charges are totally unsubstantiated. These are the fake newsers out there. And then Biden flew. Think of it. He goes into a tough place. We just met such a great deal with China. Just think of this. My guy said, if we could get 20 billion in agricultural product, that would be good. The most China ever did was 16 billion for our farmers. Okay. Were just talking about the farmers. We did banking. We did everything. But were talking about them. The most they ever did was 20 billion of product from our farmers. Our great farmers. Our patriot farmers. Our farmers that never left us even though they were being targeted by China. They never left me. So they wanted 20 in China agreed. I said, nope, no good. I want 50 billion, not 20 billion. 50. So my guys say, sir, we have a problem, sir. Our farmers cannot produce that much. Its true. I said, tell them to go out and get bigger tractors, right John Deere case, Caterpillar, all American. Only American tractors. We only buy American tractors. Go out and get bigger. So now Chinas agreed. Theyve already started buying. Hopefully the agreement gets signed sometime prior to a big summit that we have with president Xi and others in Chile. Thats in about four weeks. But they give this. They said, sir, they cant produce 50 billion. I said, I want the farmers to tell me  remember the story about winning Were going to win so much. Were going into the White House. Were going to tell the president, sir, we just cant stand winning. The state of Texas, John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, theyre going to come into my office. Sir, we just cant stand this winning in Texas anymore. Its too much. We cant handle it. Well, thats what I want from the farmers. I want the farmers to say. I want the farmers to say, sir, we just cant produce that much product. We cant do it, sir. And Im going to say yes, you can. And theyre going to say, no, we cant. Im going to say yes you can. And theyre going to go out and they get to take in 50 billion from China as opposed to 20. Thats whats going to happen. Thats whats going to happen. But they were great. They stuck with us through thick and thin. Now its really working out for a lot of different groups. In the meantime weve taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs and Chinas eaten the cost because they devalued their currency and they put money out. Tens of billions of dollars. Its cost us nothing. Billions and billions and billions. You know what I did for the farmer During the lean times, I gave them 16 billion last year and 12 billion the year before. 28 billion altogether came out of the tariffs that I had a lot of money leftover and nobody complained. You know our farmers didnt want that money. Our farmers didnt want it. True story. Everybody comes for money. Countries come for  everybody wants money, right They all want our money. The farmers said, sir, we dont want this money. Its a subsidy. We dont want it. I said, no, its not a subsidy. Youre being targeted unfairly. They said, no, sir, its a subsidy. This is true. I had 35 farmers in the oval office. Incredible people. They didnt want it. They said, sir, just give us a level field. So now I gave them a field thats more than level. Its level like this. Nice and easy. Nice and easy. But the farmers, I call them the great patriots the farmers. I never lost them. They always said, yeah, Im in trouble. I got a problem. But this should have been done many, many years ago by other presidents and other leaders. And we lose for many years 500 billion a year with China and many other countries we lose billions. We lose with everybody. But thats all changing now. But we lose 500 billion, not million. 500 millions is a lot, right We lose 500 billion. And you know what Its a disgrace that that was allowed to go on for 25 years. It was a disgrace. Disgrace. But now were taking in billions of dollars. Theyve had the worst year theyve had in 27 years and were having the best year weve ever had. So thats good. Thats good. So Biden flew with Hunter on Air Force 2. They flew to China. Hunter walked out of the plane, had a quick meeting, walked away with one and a half billion dollars. These characters back there said, oh, thats okay. Theres no problem. Can you imagine if Don or Eric Trump or Ivanka Trump, whos here someplace  right here. And by the way, our great First Lady is home watching this. She said, this is the most exciting thing Ive seen in a long time. Youre a great First Lady. Doing a great job. Shes doing a great job. Were doing a great job. The whole country now is doing a great job. So Biden takes 1,500,000,000 and he goes on and he allows China to rip us off. Remember he said a year ago No, no, Chinas good. Theyve done nothing wrong. They are wonderful people. They are all wonderful people. I dont blame China, by the way. I blame our leaders for allowing this horrible, you know what and pillage. Its the R word. You know what and pillage. You know what word Im talking about, right I dont want to use it because theyll say its a horrible word that Trump used. So the Bidens got rich while America got robbed. Tonight we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the Democrat party and nobody ever pays the price with the Democrats. Theyre so deep seeded. They never pay the price. They never pay. But maybe soon that will start. You know, weve had a lot of, weve had a lot of Obama people and Clinton people and some, to be honest with you, weve had some pretty bad Republicans down deep that didnt exactly love us. But slowly theyre getting out. They have all sorts of protections. He says get rid of them. Yeah, were trying. Get rid of them. But their partner in the whole thing is the fake news media. Thats the problem. Because the Democrats and the fake news media, its a partnership. Remember that. And you see it all the time, and Ive never seen it to this extent. You know, when I won in the primaries and then I won the election, I was treated horribly by the media, horribly. And then when I won the election, we had the greatest night, one of the highest rated nights in the history of television all over the world. And I won. And I said, oh, the great thing. I said to Ivanka, I said to the first lady, I said to anybody that would listen, I said, listen, this is so great. Finally, finally, we, all of us, were going to be respected by the media. And you know what happened They got worse. Theyre worse now than they ever have been. Theyre crooked as hell. Theyre worse now than theyve ever been. Theyre crooked. The only message these radicals, and they are radical lefties, will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd, 2020. Save that date. With your help, we will win back the house. We  With your help, we will win back the House, we will keep the Senate, and we will keep the White House in numbers like they havent seen in a long, long time. Joining us tonight are many terrific Republican leaders, and they are terrific. And frankly, if theyre not, Im not going to introduce them, okay But we have some great leaders, and you have great leaders in Texas. Great leaders, and they love Texas. A friend of mine, a guy that a lot of people werent so sure, we had this unbelievable relationship. In fact, when Ted Cruz held a rally in Washington, he said, Could you come to my rally And everybody thought, these people thought that was strange. They said to me, Well, when is the fighting between these two Because we really like each other. Whens the fighting going to start Right, Ted They said, When is the fighting going to start And I said, Dont worry, itll start. And when it does, its going to be vicious. And it was vicious, and now we love each other again. Hes great. Ted Cruz. And he had a great victory against a man that spent almost 100 million dollars. Thats a lot of money. Spent almost 100 million, but that was a great victory. Thank you, Ted. Another man whos currently running against somebody. I kept thinking maybe Beto will jump in because hes at zero right now. We hope hes going to jump in. Remember, no religion and no guns. I think thats not good. Oh, and I think hes like pretty light on oil production too. But a man and John, I have no idea who youre running against, but nobodys going to be able to beat John Cornyn. Hes a good man, youre good man, thank you, John. And we have a lot of Congress people here. We have a woman whos fantastic, who has been a fan of ours right from the beginning, Kay Granger. Thank you, Kay. We have a man whos smart as hell and he is tough and he is mean and nasty, but he loves this state and hes only mean and nasty because he wants to defend you and me and all of the horrible things that we all go through, Louie Gohmert. Louie, hes a great guy, been a great friend of mine. Ill tell you once we got him on board, he wouldnt leave us no matter what. And he had Mueller and everybody figured out long before anybody else had it figured out, right, Louie A person whos been an incredible ally, again, loves your state, Randy Weber. Thank you Randy. Great job, thank you. One of the best lawyers youll ever find. Hes slick, hes smooth, but boy hes loyal, hes talented and hes got them all buffaloed because theyre not as good as him, John Ratliff, thank you John. A man I saw on television last night defending me, brilliantly defending me. I actually dont like doing this usually, but I tweeted out, I said, Thank you very much Brian Babin. That was a great defense, I appreciate it. Thank you Brian, that was great last night. See I put a tweet out because its easier than making a phone call and talking for a half hour, thanks Brian. I just said thanks. And you know what, hed rather have that too actually, right And Lance Gooden, special person, Lance Gooden,, thank you Lance. Thank you, Lance. And Lance was one of 60 people that stuck in there, he was unbelievable. And Ron Wright, thank you, Ron. Great job. Great job. These are great people. These are great people along with Republican party chairs and all of these total winners. Heres one, Ronna McDaniel, Ill tell you what, you know, Ronna was the head of Michigan. Michigan hadnt been won by a Republican for decades and it was tough. They all said you couldnt win Michigan. I said, Why Were getting these massive crowds, why And she was in charge of Michigan and I said, I want you to do me a favor. Find out who this woman is. Shes driving me crazy. She calls me, Just one more trip, sir, one more trip. Who is she Who is she And it was Ronna and we won the State of Michigan, we won. And when it came time, when it came time to picking somebody to head the RNC, Republican National Committee, I said, What about that woman that drove me crazy from Michigan And it was Ronna and shes done a fantastic job. Thank you, thank you, Ronna. Thank you, shes fantastic. And a great governor from your state, hes a great, great man and a friend of mine. And together with your Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. Well you had a hurricane, two years ago now. They still keep calling me for money. Sir, could you give us another When the governor called up, Dan was there, Thank you for being so generous to Texas, sir, the hurricane. It was a big one, it was a bad one. A lot of water dump. I think the biggest dump of water, remember kept going in and out, in and out. Our Coast Guard saved 16,000 lives. But it kept going in and out, water, water. And finally I get a call. I paid billions and billions of dollars to the state. Like numbers, my people are driving me crazy. I get a call from the governor and Dan is there. Wheres Dan Is he here Wheres Dan Dan, Dan Patrick. And the two of them call me. And then I had Ted Cruz on my back and I had John Cornyn on my back and I had the Congressman calling and it was brutal, it wasnt even fair. And they said, Sir, thank you for being so generous on the hurricane. They made a fortune. You made a fortune on the hurricane. Thank you for being so generous, sir. Sir, we want one more small request, just a small, its not much and we appreciate your listening to us. We want to build a dam in the ocean so that if we ever have another hurricane, sir, the water wont be able to come into Houston and all of the areas that have came into, sir, do you think we could do it I said, How much Its only 10 billion. 10 billion Right Ted, right 10 billion they wanted, 10. And you know the way they sell it and its so good theyre salesman, theyre incredible salesman. They say its only 10 billion. Im supposed to be happy. Oh, lets see, could we give Texas an extra 10 billion for some, crazy thing that may work and it may not, right No, theyre great people. They love your state. RNC, co-chairman, Tommy Hicks, a real friend of ours. Thank you, Tommy. And our great campaign manager, the most sophisticated man with a computer youve ever seen. Remember they used to say with Hillary, her campaign is so sophisticated. Then after she lost, they said, Trumps campaign was so sophisticated. And remember she spent like six times more on this stuff than we did. You know the old days, my father taught me, if you can spend less, thats a good thing not a bad thing, right My father said, if you can spend less. So we spent much less then Hillary, crooked Hillary, crooked Hillary. Where are those emails, Hillary They may find those 33,000 emails. Theyre looking, they may find those deleted emails. They may find them. Remember the emails, 33,000 emails covering her gym and her daughters wedding, 33,000 thats a lot of emails for a wedding and working out. But Brad Parscale did a great job. Thank you, Brad, thank you. Thank you, Brad. And Secretary of Commerce, one of the legends of Wall Street, he was really like amazing and he is doing an incredible job, Wilbur Ross. Thank you, Wilbur. Smart guy. And a friend of mine, hes another one. He was so tough. He was nasty, man. Boy, he hit me during the campaign. I said, That guys ruthless. And when it was sort of over, there was nobody more gracious and I called him, I made him Secretary of Energy, hes done a phenomenal job. And Rick Perry couldnt have done a better job, truly, truly. And hes going to be leaving at the end of the year and probably coming back here. Whatever he does its going to be successful. But he spent three years with us and I want to thank you, Rick, what a job you done, thank you. What a job hes done. He was also a great governor of Texas that you know. In everything we do, were fighting for the faithful citizens of this country. This includes putting a stop to the catastrophic era of endless wars. Endless wars, they dont stop. They dont stop. They go on forever. We become policemen. We end up becoming police, were policing these countries. Thats not what its about. Weve spent eight trillion dollars in the Middle East. Thousands of American soldiers have lost their lives. Tens of thousands more have been severely wounded, and in all fairness, the other side has lost millions of people. Millions, millions of people, think of it. These wars brought mass chaos, instability, destruction and death. Today we choose a different path. We had tremendous success today. I dont know if youve seen it. We built in the last three years, we built the strongest military by far. And I told this story, I was embarrassed to tell it, but now Ill tell, when I first got in, a general told me we couldve had a conflict with someone said, Sir, we dont have ammunition. And I said, I never want to hear a president  I just never want to hear somebody have that statement made to them again as President of the United States, we dont have ammunition. Think of how bad. Now we have so much ammunition we dont know what to do with it. And as you all know, I guess youve been watching today. I sent Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo to lead an American delegation to meet with President Erdogan of Turkey. They got there today and it did work. Without spilling a drop of American blood, not one drop of American blood. Weve all agreed on a pause or a ceasefire in the border region of Syria and it was unconventional what I did. I said, Theyre going to have to fight a little while. Sometimes you have to let them fight a little while. Then people find out how tough the fighting is. These guys know right up here, these guys know, right Sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids in a lot. You got to let them fight and then you pull them apart. But it was unconventional, but they fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious. And the Kurds, who are our friends and Turkeys our friend. But they fought, it was tougher. I mean it was nasty and you couldnt make a deal for 15, think of it, for 15 years, 20 years, they couldnt make a deal. The Kurds didnt want to move. Turkey didnt want to budge, and Turkey was having a lot of bad things happen from this region. In all fairness to Turkey, they were having a lot of bad, but they didnt  Now all of a sudden theyre fighting and its not fun having bullets going all over the place. And we went there and we said, we want to pause, and the Kurds have been terrific. Theyre going to move back a little bit. Were going to keep ISIS all nice and locked up, okay. Were going to find more of them. And Turkeys all set and President Erdogan one was great and were going to take the worst sanctions and tariffs and everything that I put on the country, we put the worst, I mean, I dont think they could have economically survived, but that doesnt matter. President Erdogan was a gentleman. He understood it, but without a little tough love. You know what tough love is, right Without a little tough love, they would have never made this deal. President Obama lost a million people in the area, a million people, a million people. So now were doing a five day period, were going to see if we can get it all finalized and I think it will be, I think it will be. So Turkeys going to be happy. The Kurds are going to be happy, ISIS is going to be unhappy. Well deal with whoever we have to deal with, but well get it done. And its a great tribute to a lot of very talented people and thank you to Vice President Pence and thank you to Mike Pompeo. Good job, good job and theyre traveling back to our country by night. Theyre traveling back and theyll be back soon and well have a big conference on it. But it was a terrific thing and weve taken care of a lot of religious persecution. We added that in. A lot of things are in that agreement that nobody ever thought possible. So we have to fundamentally change our approach to Homeland Security as an example. In that example, nobody wouldve ever done that. You have to be a little bit different to do it that way. I took a lot of heat, even from some of our Congressman, even from some of our Senators, but now theyre all happy and Im happy with them. Im happy with them. Now, I dont know what about the Democrats The Democrats will say, Oh, what a terrible  Anything we do the Democrats will criticize. If I said, like on the China deal, We get Beijing for one dollar. They would say, What a terrible deal. It just doesnt work with them. You know the wall. We spend so much time with them on the wall and I realized about two weeks ago, all I had to do is say, We will never build a wall. And they would have come through and they said, We demand that you build it. It would have been so much easier, right. Would have been so much easier, Ted, wouldve been so much easier. American combat troops should not be at the center of ancient sectarian conflicts all over the world. Bring our soldiers back home. Bring our soldiers back home. The same people pushing us to fight endless wars overseas want us to open our borders to mass migration from these war torn and terror afflicted regions. Their policies would import terrorism right onto our shores with American issued visas. Oh, isnt that wonderful And by the way, the Democrats want open borders. They want everybody to flow in. They want those caravans to flow in, the caravans. And they wouldnt get rid of the loopholes. But you know what Mexicos been great. Mexico today had 27,000 soldiers on our border and weve stopped this horrible migration of people. And many of them are bad people. You know when countries send them up, theyre not sending their finest, okay, use your heads, theyre not sending their finest. Youve got to see some of the people. But now we send them back. And by the way, ICE is fantastic. Theyve taken out thousands and thousands of MS-13 killers. Theyve taken thousands of killers and brought them back. And now weve made deals with Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador and Mexico. But weve made deals now where we can bring back, there are 45,000 people waiting in Mexico. But its going to be very tough for these people ever to get back. When did you ever hear that Used to have no people waiting in Mexico. They just flooded. Our borders are getting strong. When the wall is complete, therell be as strong as any borders anywhere in the world. My administration believes in a simple principle, the best way to keep foreign terrorists out of America is deny them, just deny them admission in the first place. Its really pretty simple. And that is why I have imposed, and we had passed and we won at the United States Supreme Court, a travel ban on some of the worlds most dangerous countries and places. But if Democrats seize power, they would throw the floodgates wide open, wide open. We would have people coming into our country, look at whats going on in California and the people of California dont want it, they say, come into California. Well give you free healthcare, free education. Why wouldnt  I may even move to California if they keep going. No, but all it does is it brings everybody in. Whats wrong with these people Were rebuilding our military stronger than ever before and we are not going to deplete it again on stupid, senseless, endless wars. Weve invested more than two and a half trillion dollars restoring our armed forces and all of it was built in the USA and that includes approving the construction of almost 200 F-35 fighters, stealth, stealth. And many of them are built right here, right here. You know that right, in Fort Worth. As we restore our security, were also restoring our prosperity. America is winning again and America is respected again. And by the way, I have to say this, so outside they have close to 30,000 people. And I wonder if I could ask the Fire Marshal, fill up this little area, let them in, it would be so nice. You know they have a certain max, we broke the record tonight. Good place. Last month, unemployment reached its lowest level in 51 years. Seven million Americans have been lifted off food stamps since the election. What a great  One point three million children have been lifted out of poverty, think of that. And African American, Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels in history. Our great Hispanic American population has reached a poverty level, which is a all time low in U.S. history. And after years of stagnation, wages for Hispanic Americans are rising fast, up nearly eight percent since my election and everybody in the fake news would have said thats absolutely impossible. Medium income, think of this, median income for Hispanic Americans has surpassed 50,000 a year for the first time ever. With Republicans in Congress, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reform by far in American history. By the way, the Democrats want to raise your taxes, you know. I dont mean a little bit. I dont mean a little bit. I mean like double them up, triple them up and its still wont pay for the nonsense they want. We eliminated a record number of regulations and we ended the war on a thing called American energy, which is very good for Texas. Since my election, natural gas production in Texas has increased 35% and oil production has increased by 60%, six oh. And the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, world. Yet every major Democrat running for president wants to abolish all production of oil and natural gas. I think they want to go to windmills, windmills, you know. Darling, I want to watch Trump speak tonight. We cant darling, the wind isnt blowing. They want windmills. In other words, they want to annihilate your Texas economy. Can you imagine No more oil, no more natural. So here we have a few people, right No guns, no religion, no oil, no natural gas. Abraham Lincoln could not win Texas under those circumstances. Couldnt do it, couldnt do it, Ted. Couldnt do it, Louis. Abraham Lincoln, Honest Abe, couldnt do it, Louie, right Remember I used to say I can be more presidential, look. Ive always said I can be more presidential than any president in history except for Honest Abe Lincoln when hes wearing the hat. Thats tough, thats tough. Thats a tough one to beat. No, its much easier, being presidential is easy. All you have to do is act like a stiff, look. Remember the last election, they said these phonies in the back, they said, Texas is in play. They said youd toss in play too. And I came here, we had rallies like this. Thousands of people outside that couldnt get in. And I said, Why is Texas in play They say because its voting, its suppression. They try and get your hopes down. Theyre suppressed. This is just like fake news. But they said Texas, they said Texas is in play. Ladies and gentlemen, Texas is play. This is CNN, Texas is in play. President Trump  And I had guys on from Texas and theyre wearing cowboy hats. Sid and a lot of guys. They go, I dont know about you, but I know something about Texas and Donald Trump is not going to lose Texas. I can tell you that and Texas is not in play. 00 oclock and usually they have to take hours and sometimes at least even if its big, they take a half an hour. The Texas polls have closed and usually if its close, it takes hours. And if its not even just like so close, it takes a long time. So they go, Ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in the State of Texas. Donald Trump has won the State of Texas. Right, Donald Trump. And we won by a lot. We won by a lot. And we won Florida and we won South Carolina and we won Georgia and we won North Carolina and we won Pennsylvania. We won a lot. Remember these phony people, there is no way to get to 270 you had to get to  So I kept going to Maine. I love Maine, but Maine too, you get one. Its cut in half. Maine too you get one. I went there four or five times because  They got me up, the phonies, they got me up to 269, couldnt get to 270 so I went  I won, by the way, I won Maine too. I got one. But I went there and I went there a lot. Thats the beautiful thing about the electoral college, you go everywhere. You dont just spend the three  winning the popular vote would be much easier. Id rather have that. Id go to four states and relax. I went to 21 States. I used to be a believer in the other, but I think winning  Its like youre a track star. Youre working out for the a hundred yard dash or the mile, its a different form of training. Its a different form. But we did great. They said he cannot get to 270 and they were right. We got to 306. After decades of economic surrender, I have taken historic action to confront Chinas-  have taken historic action to confront Chinas rampant trading abuses, and weve made great progress. And our relationship with China is fantastic, and great things are happening. You watch. They get it now. They get it. And a lot of good things are happening. Were replacing NAFTA with disastrous, I mean, its been, to me, probably  I used to call it the worst trade deal in history. I think the World Trade has been  WTO, what a real beauty, the World Trade Organization. Thats a real beauty. They consider China a developing nation. And because youre a developing nation, Ted, right They consider China to be a developing nation, and because theyre developing, they get tremendous  And we wrote them letters. We dont consider them to be a developing nation. We dont consider India to be a develop because theyre ripping us off. And we didnt win any cases at the WTO, and now we just won 7.5 billion of countries that were taking taking advantage of us. And weve won a lot of cases lately. We didnt win anything for years practically. Now weve won a lot of cases. You know why Because they know Ill leave if they dont treat us fairly. They know it. And then the piggy bank is gone where they all rob from. Were replacing the NAFTA disaster. And we have to get this crazy Nancy Pelosi to put this thing up for a vote. We have to get her. And the USMCA is a giant victory for Texas farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, workers, and oil. The Democrats should pass it, overwhelmingly. They will. But Nancy has to put it up for a vote. Do-nothing Democrats. Theyre do-nothing. Nowhere is the Democrat betrayal of our nation more dramatic than on immigration. In recent debates, did you see these debates Do you believe what Im competing with I dont know, when I had to compete with Ted Cruz, that was brutal. He was the national debate chamption, a story Ive never told. I never did that before, right I ran for office. All of a sudden, Im supposed to be debating tomorrow night.  Who are these people The hell, I dont know all of them. I know a lot of them. I contributed to a lot of them. They used to treat me very nice when I contributed to them. Not so nice when I was their opponent, that changed a lot.  Let me see, I want to see, who are these people Im going to a debate. I never debated. My whole life has been a debate, but I never debated with a podium, and this, and that.  Who are they And we had 17 people, plus me. We had 18. It was actually not 17, it was 18. Remember Gilmore Nobody remembers him. But we had 18 people. I said, Who are these people Are they any good at debating And I hired a debate coach, and he lasted for about 10 minutes.  This guy knows less than I do. He didnt know anything. He didnt know anything, its true. He said, Never ever interrupt while theyre speaking.  Okay, coach. Put me in, coach. And after a couple of those statements, I mean  I mean, you cant beat Ted Cruz if you dont interrupt him. Its impossible. But my first  Its true. So I see, Let me see the cards. Let me see the whole thing. I want to see it. I need help. Im going to be debating in front of millions of people. And everyones saying, Do you think Trumps going to be able to debate professionally  Let me see these cards.  You know, he was president of his class. One guy was a good debater in college. He was this, he was okay. But they give me the first card, Ted Cruz, and it says, National debate champion from Princeton. Is that right And then, National debate champion from Harvard.  My potential first lady, I got a problem.  Some of these guys are okay. They were only president of the class. Almost all of them ran for president of the class. I never did. I liked playing baseball better. But I said, Melania, and I called Ivanka, I called my kids, I said, I got a problem. Ted Cruz was the national debate, he was the number one guy in college. He was the number one guy in law school. How the hell do I beat a guy thats that good at debating But we came out okay, Ted. And Ted, Ted was tough. Smart as hell and tough. Tough. Good man. But it is true. The first card I looked at, seriously, it was Ted Cruz. And he was literally, I mean, national debate, he was the best in all of college and in law school. And hes a talented guy. No, he says. I dont think so. Every single Democrat candidate for president raised their hand in favor of giving free healthcare to all illegal aliens. They want to give more to illegal aliens than they give to American citizens. You see that. As president, I will never allow the Democrats to take away your healthcare dollars and give them to people that are in our country illegally. Cant do it. In fact, I just signed an executive action to protect American healthcare benefits for all American citizens. Among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are millions of legal immigrants right here in Texas, including millions of patriotic, hardworking Mexican-Americans who play by the rules, pay their taxes, follow our laws, and strengthen our communities. Whether you are a first-generation or tenth-generation, and every American citizen, and you do, youve been treated so badly. But youre not being treated badly anymore. You know We got rid of the individual mandate from crazy Obamacare. Every American citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs, your safety, your family, your borders, and is always loyal to you for a change. Were loyal to you. My administration has reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May. And thats with no help from the Democrats. They wont close up the loopholes. They wont close the loopholes, and we could do it in 15 minutes. And were building the wall and were doing all of these things, but the Democrats wont close up the loopholes. You know what the loopholes are, right How about catch and release You catch them. You say, Hello, darling, how are you Could you please give us your name and phone number They dont have a phone. Could you give us your address They dont want to have That have a phone Could you give us your address They dont want to have an address thats in Honduras. Could you please give us your address and your name They cant. They say, Thats okay. We catch and we release, and they go into our country. And then we are getting them out of the country. And you know what Some are very good people. Some are unbelievably dangerous and bad people. And were focusing on the bad and theyre getting the hell out of our country. Okay While were fighting for shared priorities, the American people, the Democrat Party has never been farther outside of the mainstream. Theyve gone nuts. Every Democrat running for president is pushing a healthcare agenda that would utterly eviscerate Medicare. My administration will always protect Medicare for our beloved seniors. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in over 51 years. People dont talk about it. The press will not talk about it. We have news conferences. We tell them this, they will not put it in the press. You have no idea how dishonest the media is. You have no idea. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb right up until the moment of birth. And that crackpot governor from Virginia executes the baby after birth. You saw that, right After birth. You remember that one from last year. Thats why Ive asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of crazy politicians, high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. Theyre corrupt, like Schiff is corrupt. Hes corrupt. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and its the party of the American Dream. Its also the party of Honest Abe Lincoln. We forget that. We got to use that more often. Dont you think Honest Abe. I liked Honest Abe. Weve confirmed  He says Honest Donald. Thank you. Explain that to them. Youre right. Weve confirmed 152 federal judges to apply the law as written, including two Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. When I got into office, they say the most important thing a president can do, I actually think its defense, but they say is the appointment of federal judges. So when I got in, always, when you get in, there are none.  How many do you have I have none. None. So I got to, I say, How many federal judges do I have Sir, you have 142 federal judges. No, you dont understand the question. Thats impossible. That would mean that President Obama didnt appoint 142 judges. You get none. Or youre doing a bad job as president because youre representing a different philosophy. Very different.  Actually, sir, the number is 142. We were right the first time.  Obama was  Hes such a wonderful president. How are you a wonderful president when the most important thing you can do, you handed over to the Republicans. 142. How is that good I mean, how is that good If I were a Democrat, I wouldnt be too happy about that number. And well have a record number of judges by the time our term is over in 16 years, maybe 20. Im only kidding. Im only kidding because every time I do that, they say, See, hes assuming control. We have this crazy guy on television. And he goes, You know  hes talking to a guest, he goes, You know hes going to win, dont you You know hes going to win. I mean, weve done a good job. He should be happy. But he said,  Our military, our schools, our this, everything. He says, You know hes going to win. And the guest goes, Well, no, were going to fight. Were going to fight. No, no, hes going to win. And you know hes never leaving. You know that, dont you Hes never leaving. Hes never going to leave. And I thought this wacko was kidding. Hes a comedian. I thought he was kidding. Hes serious. He really believes that. We passed, for the veterans, VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of those great people. Theyve been trying to pass it for almost 50 years. They couldnt get it done. But those guys right there, and me, we got it done. And to protect American security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. I recognized Israels true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Youve seen it many times. Oh, Im so sorry. Now you have a president whos standing up for America and standing up for your great state of Texas.  about you. Im doing this for you. You know, we had, in 2016, I really believe it was maybe the greatest election. I guess George Washington was good, right But that was easy. And by the way, he did even better percentage-wise in judges than I did. He had 100%. but we could have 50%. Thats not bad. And I had many more than he had. So I guess you got to give George Washington, what do you think, Ted, you got to give him something Id say Honest Abe, that was a pretty good election, right Andrew Jackson, they say ours topped Andrew Jackson. But Andrew Jackson was a good election. But we had among the greatest elections of all time. But we have to now cement that election. We got to cement it. And once we do, its going to be very hard to take this beautiful experiment apart. Thatll be very hard. Because its all about your family. Its all about your future. And its all about the future fate of our great country. So important. With your help, we will lift millions of more citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. And by the way, thank you, Robert Jeffress, for being here, wherever you may be in this massive  Wherever you are, Robert. Where is he He got up, he started saying, He may not be the greatest person. I said  This is like four years ago, I see this guy, what a mouthpiece, this guy. And hes a man of God.  He may not be the greatest, he may not be the most perfect Christian. He may not know the Bible as well as some of us, but hes a leader. And I love Donald Trump.  Who is that guy I love that guy. Robert Jeffress. Wherever. Hes a great guy. Got a big, big group of people on Sunday mornings too, I can tell you. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words, that beautiful phrase, I love it, Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years. Were doing that. Who would have believed we could do that Were doing that. And the previous administration spent no money on that, and were spending a lot. But think of that. Who would have thought that were going to end, within 10 years, the AIDS epidemic in our country Who would have thought weve advanced that far We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that unite people all across our land and throughout the great state of Texas. This is a great state. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. Thank you. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true bedrocks of our society. We believe in the creeds of self-reliance, personal responsibility, and American independence. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together, we are taking back this country, our country. We love our country. Were returning power to you, the American people. Thats what weve done. From Dallas to El Paso, from Houston to Austin, from the Red River to the Rio Grande, this state was settled by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth. Texas. This is the state where William Travis, James Bowie and Davy Crockett made their last stand at the Alamo. This is the state where a small band of patriots at the Battle of Gonzalez, armed with a single canon, stared down a foreign army and declared,  Come and take it.  they loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. These courageous Texas patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy, demolish our liberty, and destroy our proud American heritage. We will never, ever allow that to happen. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Texas. Thank you. . Thank you."
Fayetteville,Sep19,2020,"What a crowd, what a crowd. Get those people over here. See me. Let them come over. What is a big crowd, its always big. We want to win. We got to win. We want to save our country from the radical left, the radical left crazies. Thank you very much. And hello, North Carolina, hello, North Carolina. We love you, North Carolina. Im thrilled to be in Fayetteville with thousands of loyal, hard working American patriots. And you know whats going to happen in 45 days from now, and youre watching those polls. They go up, up, up up. 45 days from now, were going to win North Carolina. Were going to win four more years in the White House. As we meet tonight, our nation mourns the loss of a legal giant Supreme Court Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Her landmark rulings, fierce devotion to justice and her courageous battle against cancer inspire all Americans. You may agree. You may not disagree with her, but she was an inspiration to a tremendous number of people. I say, all Americans Justice Ginsburgs close relationship with a friend of ours, a friend of mine, Justice Scalia, is also a powerful reminder that we can disagree on fundamental issues while treating each other with decency, dignity, and respect. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family. Thank you very much. So Article II of our constitution says the president shall nominate justices of the Supreme Court. I dont think it can be any more clear, can it I dont think so. I dont think so. What do you think, Thom Thom Tillis, I dont think it can be any more clear. This can only happen in North Carolina. I hope you hear that back home. Look at all that press. Thats a lot of press. Thats a lot of fake news. Well, I hope they hear. So the chant, this is a new one. Fill that seat. This is the chant. This can only happen to me. Fill that seat. Now it says the president is supposed to fill the seat, right And thats what were going to do. Were going to fill the seat. With a great hat. I want to try one of those hats. I love that. No, think of it. 29 times, every single time nobody said, Oh, lets not fill the seat. We won the election. Now then we have some senators that, forget it. Think of it, I wont say it. I wont say it, Susan. I wont say it, Susan. But Thom Tillis is with us. I can tell you that. Great. We have great Republican senators. We have great people and we have a great country. Thats really, we have a great country. And were going to keep it that way. So we win an election and those are the consequences. Its called fill that seat and thats what were doing. The Supreme Court was a very central issue in both the 2016 presidential election and then the 2018 midterm elections where, by the way, I didnt run. We had a lot of people, a lot of people said, Oh, he really took a little bit of a shellacking. Not nearly as bad as others. In fact, we gained seats in the Senate, but they never talk about that. They dont talk about that. We gained two seats. Nobody talked about it. But we didnt run. And I had a lot of people that, Sir, well never vote in 2018. I said, No, no vote, everybody vote. They just didnt. I think we were like 9 million people decided they wanted to wait and theyve waited and you see whats going on. You see whats happening. You see the enthusiasm that we have. Which, by the way, we set a record in 2016. The bad news for the Democrats is we are more enthusiastic now. Not even close, than we were in 2016. We are getting crowds and this is pandemic and were rounding the turn. Were rounding the corner of the pandemic. But were having them outside. And we shouldnt say this is some kind of a rally from now on. Its called a protest. We are protesters. Were going to call on our rallies that because you see a lot of these, lets call them blue states, we want to be nice. Were going to call it a protest against stupidity. So we are going to have protests against stupidity. And Pennsylvania. Look what theyre doing in Pennsylvania. A great state, thats actually something very special is going to happen here, in Pennsylvania. Thats a commonwealth. We always have to remember Pennsylvania, commonwealth. Got two of them and you better remember you get in trouble. But we love Pennsylvania. And its a shut down. The governors got it just shut down nice and tight. And you know what On November 4th, its going to be opened up. Because theyre trying to hurt our numbers. But our economic numbers are so good. Theyre staggering. Theyre the best weve ever had. Jobs, retail, stock, market, everything. And this is with a lot of shutdowns by Democrats. Thats all theyre doing. On November 4th, theyll announce, Weve decided to open up. One of the teachers groups said, actually, one of the unions and one of the politicians in California said, No, were not going to do it. We need to do it. We should be open by November 4th. That was not a good thing for them to say. That person I think was fired, I think was fired. In both the 2016 and the 2018 elections, the American people chose a president and a Senate majority united in their commitment to selecting nominees who believe in applying the Constitution as written. Both the White House and the Senate majority have a moral duty to fulfill the promises they made to the voters. And that is exactly what were going to do. We said that if for any reason, we have a vacancy on the United States Supreme Court, we will fill that vacancy. Were not going to say, and by the way, we have plenty of time. Theres a lot of time. Youre talking about January 20th. So we will uphold equal justice under the law for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. I wont be putting forth a nominee next week. It will be a woman. It will be a woman unless, wait, okay, lets do a poll. Oh, there they are. How many of these have you come to Speaking of women, how many of, what is this number one Like 90, theyre great. North Carolina, though. I see them all over the place, theyre great. Anyway, I hope your husbands are okay with it. Are they okay Theyre okay. You have good husbands. But were going to do a vote. So I said, I love these free polls because pollsters and most of the pollsters are corrupt as far as Im concerned. If we believed in pollsters we wouldnt be here right now. But were actually getting very good. We just had a 53 from Rasmussen, which is very good. Considering we won four years ago with a lot lower than 53. History has shown that when youre at 53 you cant lose an election. Has anyone ever lost an election with a 53 The answer is yes, when the other side cheats. That could happen, that could happen. That could happen. You saw what happened in Pennsylvania. Some state supreme court justice just ruled that they can take as long as they want to count the ballots. That means Ill be leading and winning Pennsylvania like we did last time. Yeah, yeah. Well be leading, well be winning Pennsylvania. Were going to win it easy. Were going to win your state easily. And Deb, what a great, shes doing such a good job. But Mark, just a few months ago, Ive been trying to get him for three years to leave and we have a great person running as you know. Really, I mean really great. Does everyone know Madison Yes Youre going to vote for Madison Hes great. Hes a great guy. But Mark had a beautiful head of black hair and I just noticed that hairs turning white very fast. But were doing a job. Were very close to a great deal with TikTok, TikTok but nobody cares about that anymore. All they care about is fill that seat, right Until about 24 hours ago, thats all they talked about is TikTok, TikTok. We have a deal worked out, I think with Walmart is going to buy it along with Oracle. Larry Ellison, its going to be an incredible combination. And I said, Do me a favor. Could you put up 5 billion into a fund for education so we can educate people as to real history of our country, the real history, not the fake history. Because were getting very close to that deal. And all of the technology will be maintained here. Theyre going to move probably to the great state of Texas. Sorry, we got you a lot of business when it came but theyre going to move into the United States, which is whats important. Theyre moving to the United States, unbelievable company. Theyre going to have 25,000 jobs. If it all goes, I gave them the preliminary approval. But theyre putting up 5 billion. And my only problem is they did it so fast. I should have asked for more. What happened is when I suggested they should put up a lot of money everybody said, senators, congressmen, women, everybody. They said, You cant do that. Thats never been done. Thats the problem, nothings ever been done. And we had other companies, a lot of people wanted it. And I said, You got to put up 5 million either to the Treasury of the United States maybe or into some education fund or do something. And they were sort of agreeing with me. They thought it was okay. And then I went to the legal legals here and I said, Theyre going to put up 5 million, give it to the United States. Sir.,You cant do that. Theres no provision. I said, How the hell can there be no provision. Were making the deal possible. Why cant they give us 5 billion dollars Thats b, thats a lot of money. Now, watch the crazy Democrats. Theyll go, They should have gotten more money. Its never been done before. They should have, no matter what you do. They should have gotten more. Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, crazy Nancy. But Ill tell you. And I said it last night, we had a great rally. Last night, you saw that in a place that were going to win. Were going to win Minnesota. Hasnt been won since 1972. And theyre all saying, Well, we did give them back the big iron ore range. It was, Obama took it away with the stroke of a pen. He put everybody out of work. We gave it back. But Ill tell you what, were going to have a victory on November 3rd, the likes of which youve never seen. Now were counting on the federal court system to make it so that we can actually have an evening where we know who wins. Not where the votes are going to be counted a week later or two weeks later. But in just three and a half years under my administration, weve secured Americas borders rebuilt the awesome power of the U.S military, think of that. And I shouldnt say this and the fake news keeps going, Oh, hes given away classified information. No Im not. We are building and we have built weapons the likes of which this world has never seen before. And I said that a week ago and it was a headline and one of these fake newspapers where, Hes giving away confidential information, these people are crazy. No, no. Im just telling you that- Crazy. No, no. Im just telling you that President Putin and President Xi of China, Russia, China, North Korea, everybody. They are so envious of what were doing. They cant even believe it. If they know, they perhaps dont know. Under Obama, they knew immediately, okay. Under us, but we are building weapons, all made in the USA. The likes of which no country has ever seen before. And hope to God, we never have to use them. Thats the key, I dont ever want to use them. Remember, I was supposed to be a guy that was going to get us into a war in the first week. Remember that Wheres the war Were taking them out of Afghanistan. Were almost finished with that. Working along well. Were taking them out of Syria, other than I left some behind for the oil, we kept the oil, is it okay that we kept the oil Is it okay we kept the oil Lets go back to my poll. Ready So were putting, I think it should be a woman, because I actually like women much more than I like men, I have to say. No, I do. I do, I like women more. So I have to make a decision, to fill the seat, as we say, we should have a new campaign. Lets make a t-shirt, fill the seat. Okay My people are so good, tomorrow, itll be all over the place. Thats a good idea. Thats a good idea. Fill the seat. Okay watch this, so good tomorrow youll see them all over the place, fill the seat. I dont know how the hell they do it, but they get it done fast. You remember I said, wheres Hunter Wheres Hunter The next day, it was like one of the biggest selling t- shirts where is Hunter What the hell ever happened He took the money and he ran I think. Wheres Hunter He took the money, he went to China, he took 1.5 billion. He had no experience. He didnt have a job until this guy became vice president. Then he went to China, he got 1.5 billion. I asked the head of a great company, Blackstone. One of the biggest in the world. I said, Steve, let me ask you a question. Is that possible No, thats never done. China doesnt do that. Well, how did a guy with no experience do this He said, Very simple. His fathers vice president. Is that what you want And then Ukraine, 183,000 a month, and a 3 million upfront payment for him and his friends, think of this, with no experience and no job, and they said, do you know energy Its an energy company that paid it. Do you know energy No, I dont. Ive not familiar with the subject. Our great Congressman. Right How the hell does this happen I think it will be brought up into debate. I think it will be brought up in the debate, I think. Where is Hunter Where is Hunter You know where Hunter is Hes probably on the Riviera having a very good time. Hes giving some great energy advice. Hes learning. Hes taking a night class on energy for 180 grand. Where is Hunter Theyre corrupt. Remember Joe with a prosecutor  1 billion, Im not giving it to them until they get those prosecutors away from my son or whatever the hell he said, that crazy company over in Ukraine. 1 billion. Im not giving it. You get them out. And guess what They got them out. Heres your billion dollars. Now thats called quid pro quo. Right Thats the real deal. With us, there was none. They made it up. Remember when Shift made the phony speech Eight times he said the same thing, except thats not what happened. Fortunately, we had those wonderful people that write every perfect word, every word. Im glad we had them because were dealing with a bunch of thieving bad people. So women and men, ready Would you rather have a woman on the Supreme Court or would you rather have a man Ready A woman or a man. So, would you rather have me choose, this is a very scientific poll. Actually, its a lot more accurate than these polls that interview like 97 people have been interviewed, then they charge you a million dollars and they probably dont interview the people. They sit behind their desk. Would you rather have a woman on the Supreme Court Yes, woman. Yes Tom tiller says yes. Or would you rather have a man on the Supreme Court Whats going on Lets give it one more quick chance. This is a free poll. And this is a lot of people. This is tens of thousands of people. This is a lot of people. You know, the fake news, theyll say, He had a smattering of people. If Bernie Sanders had a crowd. Oh, he had a massive crowd. It was so big. With me, my crowds are five times bigger than Bernies. And theyll say, He had a smattering of people. They were in the middle of an airport that nobody ever heard of. Thousands. If those people, come on, bring them over. What the hell, at this point, might as well, let them come on over. Come on over. You got thousands of people behind these people. I would imagine the sight lines arent too good. You have stands in front. Okay. So one more time. Who would rather have a man on the Supreme Court Who would have a woman on the Supreme. Now tomorrow, like fake news, CNN, he was playing games with the United States. It is a terrible thing hes done. No, Im just taking a poll, please. And by the way, thats a very accurate poll, because thats the way I feel. It will be a woman, a very talented, very brilliant woman. Who I havent chosen yet, but we have numerous women on the list. I built this incredible list of brilliant people. And were asking for Bidens list. He cant give it. You know why Because if he ever gave a list, hed either put somebody in the left middle, which would be okay. You could get votes, or hed put one, somebody, which is what hes going to choose, so far left, now, if he did the left middle, he loses his entire left coast. Right And if he loses the left coast, thats the end of his election. And last time, remember how many people I got from Bernie, because of trade. A lot of the Bernie people vote for us because Bernie is right about one thing, trade. But Bernie took a bad defeat, didnt he It was a bad loss. Hes one of the most gracious losers Ive ever seen, he is. All Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas had to do is leave. If she left before Super Tuesday, Bernie would have won every one of those States, but they split up that vote. Thats too bad, but we have Sleepy Joe, well see how that works out. I think its working out pretty good. We were winning so much, we didnt even have, we could have called off the election. We were winning by so much, and then the plane came in from China. And in many ways, I had to go back to work, but I had to go back to work on this one too. And now were going up and up and up and were winning and were winning all over the place. Because I happen to think, I just say what I want. And you know, they make up a lot of false stories. They will make up a lie. Like what I said about military. Can you imagine No animal would say that. They make it up and then they put it in ads. So once they did that, the only good thing is I can say, I said, Now I can say anything. He is the worst candidate, the dumbest of all candidates, but he was dumb in prime time, as told to me by a Senator from long ago, he said, Whos the dumbest in the Senate, whos the smartest in the Senate The smartest is, I wont tell you. But the dumbest is Joe. I said, Whos Joe. He said, Joe Biden. That was 25 years ago. That was in prime time. He is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. If I lose to him, I dont know what Im going to do. I will never speak to you again. Youll never see me again. No, how do you lose He is honestly, I go up and these guys are grilling me all the time. Stephanopoulos grill, grill. Okay. Its all right. Its okay. I think it came out very, well its always, it comes out well. You have to be able to answer. Theyre very weak compared to some of the foreign people that we deal with from foreign countries, leaders of foreign countries. But I say hes always using a teleprompter. I dont care if he uses a teleprompter, you know what bothers me That means the fake news is giving him the questions. So thats what really they never gave me the questions. If I ever said, in fact, Im going to say it now. I want from now on you to give me the questions before you ask me. And Im going to read the questions off the teleprompter, and the questions are so easy. Did you see Anderson Cooper Hes a nice guy. Hes interviewed me over the years, a lot, but hes a tough interviewer. Did you see those softballs What do you think Donald Trump is a very bad human being. Do you agree with that Yes, I do, Anderson. Ive never seen softballs, and actually theyre getting hit by it. Theyre getting hit by it. Its just a terrible thing. I mean, this is a guy, I used to call him 1% Joe, because he ran numerous times and he could only get 1%. In fact, he actually had 1% with an arrow pointing left. That means less than one. Now hes shot, hes got half of his head left, and hes out, think of it. Hes totally shot. And he ends up getting the nomination. He couldnt get it in prime time. What the hell is going on with the world today Whats going on Whats going on with the world, Mark Meadows Unbelievable Meadows, oh boy. Hes a smart guy, Meadows, great, great guy, North Carolina, in just three and a half years, we obliterated the ISIS caliphate. Remember when I had it down to 99%, they said, You got to finish it. I said, Let somebody else finish it. And we went, and we finished it. We fixed our disastrous trade deals, which we have. Chinas now paying us billions and billions of dollars. But you know, I view it differently now, I view China much differently now, after the plague came in, I view it differently. And we brought your jobs back home to North Carolina and our contract. In three years of President Trump, real median household income rose by almost 7,000. Now think of that, three years, three years, right Achieving the highest median income in the history of our country. This is in three years. Under 16 years of presidents, Barack Hussein Obama, ladies and gentlemen, is President Barack Hussein Obama, or as Rush Limbaugh, the great, how great is Rush Do we love Rush As Rush Limbaugh would say, Barack Hussein Obama. You ever hear Rush Barack Hussein Obama. Rush is great. Hes doing well too. Hes great. Hes a tough guy. We love Rush. We love you Rush. He watches every one of these rallies. You know, he supported me when I came down with our great first lady, I came down the escalator. I made a speech. I didnt even have a speech writer, I had to wing it. The winging speeches are the best ones like last night. But Rush said, I like that guy. Id never heard that before. Id never heard were going to build a wall. Were going to have secure borders. Were going to make new trade deals that are like sane. Were going to do all the things were going to rebuild our military. Were going to have a strong country again. We did so many things, and Rush heard this. I didnt know Rush. I mean, maybe I met him once, twice, for two seconds. And he became an instant fan of Trump. And he was for a long time before I even got to know him. And hes been so important, hes the King, 39 million listeners. Theres nobody like him. Try sitting down for what is it Three hours And talking, just talking with everyone. 39 million people, often. Try sitting. We love Rush. I love Rush. But listen, try sitting down with a radio show with millions and millions of people listening, and talk for three hours without phone calls. Phone calls are easy. Hey, what do you think of this What do you think. Just talk. Talk. And everybody finds it fascinating. And it is fascinating. I wish I had time to listen more often. Its a little tough as president, but everybody finds it fascinating. And we gave Rush, because hes such an important person and done such an incredible job the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And Catherine, his wife is great. What a couple. But Rush has been unbelievable. Hes so on our side. And he was from literally day one, right from the beginning. And we dont have to mention Sean, and Laura, and so many others. We dont have to mention Lou, the great Lou Dobbs, right I mean, Lou Dobbs said, Lou started years ago, and he liked us from the beginning. He said, Donald Trump is going to be a very good president. Okay. That was the first little time. Then he went, Donald Trump. I love Donald Trump, but hes the best since Ronald Reagan. Then he went, Donald Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan. So that was about a year and a half into it. Then the great Lou Dobbs said, Donald Trump may be the greatest of all time. Greatest of all time. And then somebody said, Can I ask you Lou, when you say the greatest, does that include Abraham Lincoln and George Washington He said, Absolutely. Hes now the greatest of all time. So we love Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs is great. Go out and buy his book. His book is great. But we have great support. We have great support. Tuckers been very good lately, I have to tell you. Tucker has been very good. Tucker Carlson, hes come a long way, actually the whole thing with faking around with our whole history. Hes very strong in that, we took care of that very powerfully, very powerfully. We signed an executive order. We fired a lot of people that were talking about cancel culture and a lot of fake stuff, that were getting paid a lot of money that were here for a long time. Under 16 years of presidents Obama and Bush, the median income only rose 2,900. Now think of that. So three years, it went up 7,000, 16 years, it went up less than 3,000. Id say thats a big difference. And thats not including energy, because look what youre paying for your gasoline now. Right Remember those days Remember those days of 5, you said, Lets get rid of that big truck. Now youre all buying bigger trucks than they ever thought possible. You know why Because gasoline is so damn cheap, right Remember the 5 days Now youre below 2 a lot, right Below two. I mean, theyre seeing numbers that nobody believes. Its all good stuff. And were energy independent. So many things have happened. If you add four or 5,000, so youre talking about by 11,000, you got to add the energy. I said to my people, Put the energy in. Well, I dont know if its right. I said, Do me a favor, just put it in. In my first three years, we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any president in American history. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now were doing it again, and were doing it very rapidly. This is a super V. They said, Oh, I dont know, V is going to be very hard. No, this is a super V. We will deliver a safe and effective vaccine this year. Its already in very good shape. Very, very good shape. In a matter of weeks. We will end the pandemic from China. We will end our plague from China. Next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country, its heading that way. If you take a look, automobile manufacturing, housing, retailing, theyre all setting records, theyre through the roof, hard to believe, actually, during the rounding the corner, when I say rounding the corner, they go crazy. They want to keep it going as long as possible. If you say anything positive, they say, Hes not telling the truth to the American public. I am actually telling the truth. You know these people, they talked about, because I said, Well, Winston Churchill was a great leader. They said the other night, You said Winston Churchill was a great leader, but he didnt lie. Because this guy, Woodward. He writes a book. Hes had it. Hes another one shot. I compare him sort of to Biden. Hes sharper than Biden, I have to say that, but hes shot. Hes tired. Hes exhausted. I never saw a guy be able to do so much television, try doing a book on somebody else. See how much television time they give you, like none. But they said the other night, and it was amazing. Winston Churchill. They said, He didnt lie to the people, to Britain. He didnt lie. I said, Well, let me ask you this. He stood on buildings when the Nazis, Hitler, were bombing London. Thats pretty brave, because he may have been doing a little drinking, but he was known for that, right Hes got a right to, but its true. He stood in the buildings in London, as they were bombing London, and made speeches, and made statements, and had everything. And hed sometimes have press conferences. And the fake news wouldnt show up. He was standing there, nobody was in front of him. But he would stand there, and he would say, You are safe. You are safe. Everything is okay. You are safe. Well, thats a lie, I guess, right So I said, Oh, I never thought of it that way. I guess he lied. No, hes a great leader, and he was leading, and he was a great, great prime minister. He did a fantastic job. Not lying. No. We love our country, we want to lead our country, and we cant let a thing like this, this is a horrible, horrible thing that happened to the world it happened, should have been stopped in China. They stopped it from going into the rest of China, should have been stopped in China. To defeat the China virus, we launched the largest industrial mobilization since World War II. Somebody said, What grade would you give yourself I said, A. But I would give myself a D, I would say I would give myself, and my whole group, because Mike Pence is great, Mike Pence really was. He worked so hard. And its unfair, he worked so hard. The ventilators, the vaccines, the therapeutics now we have, look at whats happening. When somebody gets very sick, look how we bring them back so often, compared to what it was originally. I mean, the work thats been done, and wait until you see what happens over the next few weeks with whats going on. But the Democrats dont want the vaccine. They dont want it. At first, they wanted a vaccine, because they didnt think it could happen. Now that we have it, theyre going like, Well, we dont want it. Its the craziest thing. Think of it, you want to get a vaccine, and theyre willing to hurt people, let people die for political reasons. Think of it. I think, honestly, I think its a disgrace. But we surged rapid testing kits. We have more testing than all other, I mean, practically everybody. You look at number two is India. They have 1.5 billion people. We are up 50 million tests more than India. In fact, were about to crack 100 million tests. And when you test, then you have, does this make sense Then you have cases. So we do all this testing, and I come home and I turn on NBC News. It is so bad. I think NBC, thats not only MSDNC. I think NBC with Lester Holt. Theres another beauty. Hi Lester. How do you feel big in second place Lester He surged from first place to second place. But NBC News is so, I mean, its just terrible. They use free airwaves, and then they give you fake news. Free airwaves. They should pay a lot of money for this. This is not right. NBC. Its owned by a company called Concast, C-O-N, Concast, theyre con, theyre con men. Its a disgrace. They spend fortunes on public relations and then I get up and make a speech like this with television blazing all over the world, I guess. Yeah, the world, its all over the world. And I say Concast, and immediately, there goes their public, hows your public relations doing NBC Not too good. But theyre just they dont tell the truth. Our country would be so much better off if we had honest media, really. Really would. And do you see what their approval rating has gone to I think its one of my greatest achievements. Hey look- Its a Saturday night. We have all night. This happened last night in Minnesota. I have these teleprompter people, theyre great, theyre genius. And I was about 45 minutes into the speech, and I realized I was only on line two. And he was like, What do I do But we have more fun. Hey, you now have a president that doesnt have to use a teleprompter, isnt that nice And I said last night, I said, and yeah, your friends were there. The Congressmen. By the way, is the media now, and Im pretty sure its getting close. I think they have a lower approval rating than Congress. Congratulations. No, but its hard. When youre sitting there, youre in businesses, youre in construction, you drive trucks, you do a lot of things. Youre in offices. You dont realize, because you dont know whats happening. I know exactly a true story. And then its written to totally bend the truth, to make a good thing into a bad thing. Like, can you believe it, in one week they nominated me, not for one, but for two Nobel prizes. No, but think of it. No but think. And they didnt cover the story. Now Obama got his the first week. Very liberal group, and nobody knew what the hell he got it for, and he didnt know. Why did you get it I dont know. Remember I dont know. I have no idea. But you know, you have a president, you love your president, and your president gets honored, because Im not being honored, youre being honored with the Nobel Peace Prize, for Israel, what we did with Israel. I went home and I said to the First Lady, Darling, shes very popular. She made a great speech, right And Ivanka made a great speech, right But I went home. I said, Darling, I have big news tonight. Lets turn on the television. You know, we dont use wind. We use actually, we actually use petroleum. We use Petro. Because we like it to be on like a lot. We dont like to have lots of open gaps when the winds not blowing. We cant watch President Trump. I go home. I say, First Lady, a great thing happened today. I was honored, Nobel Peace Prize, nominated. This is a big thing First Lady. And then I went home two days later. I said, First Lady, youre not going to believe it. I was honored again. Nobel Prize, thats Kosovo. Israel, Kosovo. I said, First Lady, this is great news. Lets turn on the television. This is going to be big. This is going to be big tonight. We just got honored, this is big. Nobel Peace, can you imagine You grow up in Brooklyn, Queens, and now youre getting the First Lady, lets turn on the television. Lets turn onto that fake NBC news. And I see we have a storm. Okay, First Lady, dont worry about it. The storm is big. We have it taken care of, FEMAs down there, Florida, Alabama, Georgia. We got FEMA down there. Its being taken care of. We always take care of it. We take good care of it. Texas, Louisiana. We took good care of him two weeks ago. All right First Lady, dont worry about it. Its the next story, Im sure, its the Nobel Prize for peace. Were stopping mass killings between Kosovo and Serbia. Theyve been killing each other for so many, theyre going to stop killing. I said, fellas, lets get together. Theyd been doing it for hundreds of years, frankly, under different names. I said, thats great. And with Israel, UAE and Bahrain signed a deal with Israel. Everybody said it couldnt be done. I said, All right, First Lady, thats the first story on NBC, but dont worry. Thats a big story. The floods are big. I see it. And then there was a second story about something. And then their third story is about something with me, I dont know, something bad they found out. Then there was a fourth and a fifth and a sixth. I said, First Lady, Im a little embarrassed. I thought wed do a little better. And then they looked at the screen, and said, Good night. And I wasnt covered. I got the Nobel Peace Prize nomination, a Peace Prize, Nobel nomination. And they didnt cover it. And then the following day I watched a certain show that does like us, and they said, Would you believe, that they covered, and they mentioned like five subjects that were nothing. That was 18 minutes. And the Peace Prize Nobel version, zero time for President Trump. Thank you very much fake news media, we appreciate it. And when Obama got it, here are the headlines. President Obama gets the Nobel Prize. We need an honest media. The free airwaves, they lie over the free airwaves. They use them and they lie. I dont know. Were going to have to look at it. Theyre a bunch of scoundrels. They hate it when I say it, but you know, honestly, they are the enemy of the people. When they lie, they are the enemy of the people. You are the enemy of the people. Oh, damn it. The red lights just went off. One, two, three, theres one back there, theres one back there, probably, oh its OAN, thank you OAN. Every time I get on this subject, they cover me not because they want to, but we get great ratings. We get ratings. These little deals that we have here, come on in folks, come on in. Look at these people. But you know what Ill tell you what, its true. They cover it because But anytime I start talking about the fake news media, you see them getting a little tentative. The camera starts to shake a little bit, and you know, theres another thing. Look at this crowd. Its as far as the eye can see, its a big crowd, right They never cover it. I said to my wife last night, we had this incredible crowd. A lot of people, thousands and thousands. I mean like 25, 30,000, many people outside couldnt get it. It was like a sea of people. My wife said, Was it a large crowd I said, Did you watch Yes. But they only show your face. And I saw people they never show. And that includes Fox, which has changed a lot, changed a lot, sad. Somebody said, Whats the biggest difference between 2016 and now You know what I said, Fox. Biggest difference. Biggest difference. I dont know whats going on with them. But we have some great ones too on Fox. We surged rapid testing kits to every nursing home in America. We learned a lot, through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate by 85% since April. Think of that 85%. Weve come up with things. Theyre waiting to see whats coming over the next few months in terms of therapeutics, which to me is even more important than the vaccine. You go into the hospital, you make people better. You give them a shot, you do a transfusion. You make people better. They walk out, thats to me even better, but ultimately long-term, those vaccines are going to be great, and theyre really working out well and its going to be really soon. The people in certain groups are trying to hold them up as long as possible, as long as possible. Theyre going to try and give Sleepy Joe the credit. He doesnt even know what a Its possible. Theyre going to try and get Sleepy Joe the credit. He doesnt even know what a vaccine is. Europe is almost 30% higher excess mortality than the United States. Does anyone know that they dont report that, right Europe Europes had a hard time. Im not looking to hurt them, but they have 30% higher. Our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs, including 1.3 million jobs, and a wonderful place called North Carolina, right When I banned travel from China in January, Sleepy Joe Biden called it, Thats hysterical. Thats xenophobic. What does that mean Tell me what xenophobic means, Sleepy Joe. Who said that I mean, youre my friend. Who said it All right, what a voice. Have you ever tried opera What a voice, did everybody hear that Thats true. I wouldnt say it. She said, He has no idea where he is. But I would never say it. I wont say it. I wont say it. I refuse this. No, but dont underestimate him. Look, hes been doing this for 47 years, and I got a debate coming up with this guy. No, its true. You never know, you never know. They give him a big fat shot in the ass, and he comes out, and for two hours, hes better than ever before. Problem is what happens after the  No, were going to ask for a drug test, we are. Id like to have a drug test. Both of us. Ill take it, hell take. Because I watched him into debates with all those people, those Democrats. The one who treated him worst was Kamala. Actually, also, she was the one that treated, you know that, she was the one that treated him so badly. And she treated Kavanaugh very badly too. Nobody was ever ruder, nobody ever suffered, like Justice Kavanaugh suffered in the hands and the mouths of those horrible people. The way he was tortured was disgraced. And they had nothing. Those women, that was all made up. Most of them have already admitted, it was all made up lies, false accusations, and they made him suffer. And the leader of the pack I would say was, Kamala was the worst, and Pocahontas was a close second. Hows Pocahontas doing, since she destroyed Bloomberg How about Bloomberg Did he get killed Now hes trying to come back. Hes trying to buy his way back into the Democratic Party. Im going to put up 100 million in Florida, were going to go, he wants to be back so badly. Heres a guy who spent 2 billion, its almost two billion now, theyre finding out. He had some of the dumbest advisers, people I know, some of the dumbest people. If he would have just kept spending a couple of hundred million dollars a week on ads, he could have won. He could have won. Unfortunately, he said, No, I want to debate. He went and sued to get into the debates. That was not a good lawsuit. They settled by saying, Well let you in the debate. The first question, he was destroyed. You would think that, the way the Democrats treated him, he would really come to me, and hed say, I want you, but his hatred and jealousy  He wanted to be President, but he doesnt have the capability of being President. But hes going down now to Florida, hes going to spend 100 million. How good  I have to say this, Im not a fan of Elizabeth Warren. I gave her the name Pocahontas, I thought that was the end. Remember what I used to say about her She has  Oh, well, you know it. You know. I would just, look, I said, This is not an Indian. She said, Im an Indian. You remember what I said I have more Indian blood than me, I have more in me than she has, and I have none. Unfortunately, Id like to have some. I would like to have some. I think it could help, it might make me better, but I have none. And I said, I have more than she does. And then she went out to, and she choked, remember that She went out, and she took a test. And it found out that about 700 years ago, there was a possible event, 1,024th, right Wasnt that it Good memory, very good memory. Trump has a good memory. Good moment. Not for that, but for a lot of things. Now, 1024th, which meant many, many, many centuries ago, there could have been a hookup somewhere along the line. But she choked. We forced her into a choke. She went down like a rock, and then she started coming up, up, up, up, up. Then she totally destroyed Mike Bloomberg. We call him Mini Mike. Remember Mini Mikey wants that platform. I want a platform, damn it. I dont mind. Oh, boy, he was pathetic, but now hes going to try and buy his way back into the Democrat party. You remember that guy Great environmentalist. Except he made his money with coal, which is okay, I think coal is good. Clean coal, I like clean coal. If we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. You know that. He was way behind. This was months later. And then I watch him last night, reading something saying that, I opened, I closed it up, one week later, one week. Two months later, he was talking about the fact that I shouldnt be doing that to China. I shouldnt be banning China because I was xenophobic. And its just unbelievable. And now they will say anything. Its called disinformation. They will make up a lie, they will make up a story, and they go with it, it makes no difference whether or not its show, and theyll take ads. Its the worst group of people. Hes surrounded by bad people, dishonest people, but theyre very smart. Hes not smart. They keep him from talking. Its actually, if he wins, its the single most brilliant campaign in the history of the world. Because they took a man whos got nothing. He didnt have it, but hes got nothing, and I will give them credit. The single greatest campaign in history, if he wins, but you know what If he wins, North Carolina is screwed, and so is every place else. And you can forget your tobacco industry, you can forget your farmers. I gave the farmers 28 billion. Thank you very much, Presidency. 28 billion. Because you were targeted, right You were targeted by China. And I said, How much were the farmers, Iowa, Nebraska, you, all of them You were targeted. I said, How much Sonny Perdue, I said, How much, Secretary 12 billion, then 16 billion, you were targeted. I took it out of the tariffs we charge. We never took 25 cents in from China, now were getting billions and billions and billions of dollars. Sleepy Joe, that never gave, never took anything, or Trump, misjudging him So Mexico, were driving them a little crazy. They dont like Trump too much. But now Biden is recklessly campaigning against his vaccine. His campaign campaigns really reckless. And all it is is for political reasons. Its political reasons. Biden, his whole deal is catastrophic shutdown. Were getting better, were really coming along, and hes talking about shutting down. Were not doing any shutdowns. We dont need shutdowns. Maybe a little area, if its such a spike, we understand, we have to take care of our senior citizens. This guy talked, he said, Well, Ill do whatever my medical people want. I believe in science. He doesnt know what science is. I believe in science. No, were not doing any shutdowns. We dont need, were rounding the turn. Without the vaccine, were rounding the turn. With the vaccine, itll just speed it up. Thats another one that will be controversial. Theyll say, Hes saying that its happened. Yeah, without the care, without the vaccine, its going along. With a vaccine, even better. Itll be faster. Bidens own chief of staff said, when they manage the H1N1 that he calls the N1H1, right He goes, the N1H1, and thats an easy one, because H comes before, but he always gets it wrong. Its like, seven times, Its great to be with the great people of Iowa. Theyll say, Sir, youre in Idaho. Oh. Ive never made that mistake so far. But I always say, If you do, just leave the stage, because you can never recover. You can speak as well as, I mentioned, Winston Churchill, even though he was a great speaker, he was a stutterer, and he became one of the greatest speakers ever. You could be Winston Churchill, if you make that mistake, just leave the stage. You cant recover. But hes made it oftentimes, right, in New Hampshire, and it was Vermont. The worst, I think, I think there was one, he was in Ohio, and he said he was in Florida, right But he couldnt find any palm trees. We just got a poll from Ohio. Through the roof. Great state of Ohio, good Governor, great state of Ohio. But when they managed the H1N1 swine flu, this was from his top person that ran it. We did every possible thing wrong. 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time. And it was just a total disaster. He basically said, We didnt know what the hell we were doing. And this is the guy thats going to tell us what to do with something thats much more lethal, much more lethal. This is much more lethal than the swine flu. If H1N1 had the same fatality rate as the China virus, over two million people would have already perished. They didnt know what the hell they were doing. And the guy admitted it. That guy can not be very popular in Democrat politics right there. But just to remember, and hes telling us how to do things. Were building ventilators, were the ventilator capital of the world now, think of it. Were sending them to other countries, we have so many. And we have made a lot of Governors look very good. And they all admit it, until the press comes in front, where they say, Oh, he was okay, but we took care of them. We took care of Governors, we took care of the states. On November 3rd, North Carolina will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, or whether we allow Joe Biden to impose a 4 trillion tax hike, ban American energy, confiscate your guns. These are all things that he said. Shut down our economy, destroy the suburbs. They were saying that women in the suburbs, theyre not sure if they like me. Theyre starting to like me a lot lately, because its law and order. They want law and order. Thank you. A suburbanite, thank you, thank you. No, its true. I dont know. But I heard the same thing four years ago, remember  Women will not vote for him. Then we win the election, its like, theyre all in shock. Well, what took place Well, he did very well with women, what the hell was that all about, right Did very well. Women were great. Now, if it holds true  There a lot of jobs, a lot of jobs, a lot of great thinking, but he wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens. Now, what thats going to do is destroy our country, because two things happen. Number one, we cant afford it. Number two, everybody is going to come pouring into our country if you do that. Right now, theyre saying, wherever they are, when you say, Were going to give you free education, were going to give you free healthcare. Were going to take care of you. Everythings going to be perfect. Were going to give you, every single family, now watch, theyll print this. Weve checked it out, and he lied about this. Every single family is going to be given a brand new Silver Cloud Rolls Royce. Now, I said that, and CNN went, He lied about the fact that theyre not getting a Rolls Royce. Remember what I said  Russia, if youre listening, in front of this message, Russia, if youre listening, find out where her e-mails, or whatever. And then, everybody laughed, I laughed. Well, they actually play it all the time. When he spoke to Russia. Do you ever see it And they cut it off before the end, they dont see any, I said, Russia, if youre listening  Oh, these people are sick. He wants to erase your borders. Yeah, that was supposed to be a joke, right It was a joke. It was a joke, everybody was laughing, but they refused to go that extra quarter of a second. He wants to indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in education. To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I am launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called, 1776 Commission. Its already done. Thats good. And its true, your kids come home, and they tell you things. How many of you, the kids come home, and they tell you things. Its a disgrace, what theyre teaching them, its a disgrace. Were ending it. In fact, were taking school funds away from these crazy schools that are teaching horrible things, bad things, actually. We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth. And we are getting better every single day. And no party can lead America, that will not teach our children to love America. No party can do that. The sleepy campaign has joined forces with those trying to tear down America and our way of life. We have a great way of life, and getting better all the time. Look at what weve done. Bidens running mate urged supporters to help bail rioters out of jail, including one who attempted murder. Thats right. One who attempted to murder a police officer, and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, 13 members of Bidens staff donated to the same fund. Look, thats where theyre coming from, just so you know. Hes trying to go a little bit more right, like the fracking. Oh, well of course, were going to have  For six months, hes saying, therell be no fracking, which I dont think the people in Pennsylvania thrilled with, do you agree, considering that your taxes could quadruple. I tell it all the time, Texas, right Texas, they like oil. They like guns, right, in Texas. Right And they like God. So he comes out with a platform, no oil. We dont want oil. This is during the Democrat deal. Therell be no oil, therell be no God, therell be no guns. This is not a good campaign. And then the fake news says, Donald Trump is tied in Texas. Im tied. Last time I was tied in Texas until the day of the vote. Then they announced, the second they called it, The polls in Texas have closed. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas. Think of it. Hes against oil. Hes against guns. Theyre going to confiscate your guns, Second Amendments going to be destroyed. I am holding up your Second Amendment. If its not me, look what Ive done. You think its been easy They want to get rid of the Second Amendment. Theyre going to get rid of the guns, right And religion. So, look what theyre doing to religion. These states, everythings closed, except, youre allowed to protest. Thats why I say everything we do is a protest. Look at all those people back there, look at that. Look it, they just form. Wow. Turn the cameras around, please. They never do it. Turn the cameras around, please. Wow. Thank you. Thats a lot of people. Were proud of you. Thats a lot of people. You ever notice, they never do it, though. I say, Turn the camera. Right from the beginning, they never did. They dont want to give us the credit for these big crowds, because you know what When you see crowds like this, or in Wisconsin, that I had a few nights ago, or last night was so incredible. What we had last night was just incredible, in Minnesota. Were going to win it, 1972, were going to win it. 1972, it hasnt  Thats a long time ago. Remember I think Reagan won every state except for Minnesota. Were going to win Minnesota. What weve done for them, weve opened up their livelihood again. Maine. How about Maine I opened up 5,000 square miles of ocean. Obama closed it. They said, Why He had no idea. Right off their shore, no fishing, no nothing. They called it a monument, right Right off their shore. Maine, I mean, if I dont win Maine  Maine traditionally is not really very Republican, but I won Maine too last time, actually. Because I love Maine, too. I love Maine, too. But think of what I did. I opened the waters up for fishermen and for lobster men and women. Now they go lobster fishing and fishing. But 5, 000, I said, Why did they close it Nobody was able to tell me, but I opened it up, an executive order. I totally opened it up. I did many other things. Then I got the tariffs. They couldnt do business in European Union, they couldnt do business in China, because they were charging tariffs to Maine. So Canada would take our fish and lobster. Wed sell it to Canada for nothing, and theyd sell it to China and Europe, because they didnt have to pay tariffs. Not only did I get the 5,000  Think of what, 5,000 square miles. So you take one mile, square mile, multiply times 5,000. Thats a big area, even in an ocean, right Its massive. And it was the best area, the best. I got rid of the tariffs. I told them, If you tariff our Maine lobster people, and fishermen and women, if you want a tariff on them, thats okay, but were going to tariff your cars, okay Which is a much bigger deal. It was amazing how quickly those tariffs were taken off. I did that off of Maine, I did that in two weeks, okay Took me two weeks. Once I found out about it, its hard to believe it ever happened. So I did that for Maine. And somebody said, Im down in Maine. How the hell can I be down in Maine, after what I did Ill tell you what if I do that from Maine, and if Maine doesnt vote for Trump. I dont think Im going back, okay I can tell you one thing. Their Senator never did it for them. Joe Biden and the Democrats want to gut police departments nationwide. You know that, right Here in North Carolina, nearly 50 Democrat State House members and candidates have signed a pledge to slash police funding, endangering your families. I was recently honored to be endorsed by 54 sheriffs throughout this state, and were joined by many of them tonight. Where are they Thank you, Sheriff. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, folks. Thank you. Thank you. You got to take care of our law enforcement. We got to take care, nobody can do the job like them. We have to let them do their job. Weve got to stop this nonsense, this childs play, weve got to stop, theyre great. You know, I was endorsed by, think of this, New Yorks finest. Its very tough. You know, de Blasios your mayor, he doesnt have a clue whats happening, either. I think Sleepy Joes worse, do you want to know the truth Because this other guy has just an ideology thats just terrible. But de Blasio is there, and New Yorks finest, first time theyve ever endorsed a Presidential candidate, they endorsed me, three weeks ago. That takes courage. Think of it. Chicago, the police in Chicago, they could do their job. We dont even have to bring in the National Guard. Whenever we do, it takes about 30 minutes, its over, right Like we did in Minneapolis, 30 minutes. Remember that beautiful scene They lined up, they went down, there was no social distancing in between these great, tough guys. There was no social distancing, Tom Tillis. They went down and they had 250,000 outfits. They had more crap on that helmet with night goggles. And these guys were sort of wise guys, right They were shouting at them, screaming at them. They were screaming at the wrong people. They went down, they never had to stop. It was just forward. It all ended. It all ended in Minneapolis. It took, you also had, what A half an hour Remember, they hit the CNN reporter in the knee He went down, Ali Velshi. He said, This is a friendly protest. Its wonderful to see such a  Behind him, it was all fire for a block. It looked like Berlin during the war. This is a friendly  What are they doing How does that help to be like that How does that help Were joined tonight by some really great friends of mine and some warriors that have been a fantastic help to me. One man who, especially over the last year, he has been so great, he couldnt be better. And I think hes doing very well. Im looking at some numbers, and youre doing very well.

And North Carolina Republican Party Chair, Michael Whatley. Michael Thank you, Michael. Great job, Michael. How are we doing, Michael Hows it going Are we up I mean, if I lose North Carolina, Im getting out of here. This is not  Look at that. This is not, just so you know, the crowd of a man thats coming in second. I say it all the time. I said it when I left Michigan. 2016, the night of the election, we had 32,000 people. Hillary was there, just before me, in a prime location. She had about 400 people. I got there at 12 in the evening, I started speaking at one in the morning, its now Election Day, and I left. 32,000 people, we had 32,000 people. So its now Election Day. I start speaking, I started speaking, think of it, one oclock in the morning, we had 30, you never saw anything like it. I left. I said, That doesnt look like were going to lose Michigan. And guess what We didnt. We won Michigan, first time in decades. And you know what weve done Many, many car plants are now opening up. A great gentleman, whos just retiring, Prime Minister Abe, of Japan. I said, Shinzo, please do me a favor. We need more car companies. Youre selling cars into our country, please. We want to build here, not in Japan, please. He said, But we cannot do that. This is a free enterprise system. I said, I know, Shinzo, please. I need some car companies. Please do it. I cant do it. I said, Shinzo, you have to do it. Next day, it was a story, Five car companies to open up in Michigan, right So much for free enterprise, but hes a great guy, hes a friend of mine. Hes great. Theyre lucky hes a friend of mine. I would have been much tougher. Its hard. When a guy is a friend, its hard, but they did a lot. They did a lot. They helped it a lot. And what theyve done here, by the way, Japan, and what theyve done in Michigan, Ohio, what theyve done By the way, we all love South Carolina, right, right I think we love it. Now, South Carolina, were winning here, but South Carolina, I hate to say this to you, I dont want to make you upset. Were winning by about 400 points. I spoke to a great person in South Carolina who said, Sir, you dont have to come here. This things up by a lot. What the hell is the difference, right I mean, we are up, and were up good, but Id love you to tie South Carolina. What do we have to do But a lot of activity in South Carolina also, theyre doing great. You had the best year youve ever had. Theyve had the best year they ever had. And youre going to go to a better year, we are going to have a better year. Were also deeply honored to be joined by a military spouse, Amy Williams, who was reunited with her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, at my State of the Union address. Everybody remembers that. Everybody remembers was there. Good, youre looking well. Thank you very much. Say hello to the whole family. Thank you. Thanks to the incredible sacrifices of our warriors, and they are warriors. Were pursuing peace in Afghanistan, its very close. Were down to, we will soon be down to 4,000 soldiers. Were taking them out. Theyre serving as policemen. Theyre serving as police, and theyve done a great job. We could win everything, but Im not looking to kill three million people to win, what To win what We should have never been in the Middle East, and were bringing them back. Were bringing them back, just so you know, were bringing them back from Iraq. Were down to 2,000 soldiers in Iraq. And in Syria, were all back, were all finished, except for one thing. If its okay with you. I decided to keep the oil. We took the oil, we kept it. And well always support Americas incredible military families. So thank you very much. Thank you, darling. Really good. Okay. In everything we do, were putting America first, unlike other administrations, and not just Obama and Biden. This has gone on for many years. We put America first, and thats what were doing. And you know what Other countries, for the first time in decades, respect us again. Remember that. They respect us again. You know all about data, 28 countries. We had six countries that were current, and the amount of current is too low, okay Six countries. I went in, and I said, You got to pay. Sorry, youre delinquent. They said, Really Yeah, I said. Youre delinquent. You got to pay. Obama would go, and make a speech and leave, that would be it. We were paying for it. Were protecting Europe, and theyre screwing us on trade. So we protect them, and theyre screwing us on trade. No good, no good. Cant do it. I said, Its unfair. And the Secretary General, Stoltenberg, of NATO, said, Ive never seen, and the fake news can call him up and check. He said, Hes the greatest that weve ever seen. For 20 years, the spending at NATO went like this, right And America, we pick it up. Every time it goes down, they didnt pay. And I said, Were supposed to protect you. Youre going to be attacked by Russia or somebody, were supposed to protect you. And yet youre delinquent. You dont pay your bills. And that includes Germany. Theyre paying 1%, theyre supposed to pay two, and 2% is way too low. 2% military spending. So we got, listen to this. It never gets reported by these fakers. We got 130 million more, more, not total, more, going to, over three years, 400 billion. So were going from 130 billion, with a B, not million, to 400 billion. And they said to me, they said  And they said to me, they said to me, very nice guy, head of one of the countries, at a table. I cant believe it never got released, but now we can talk about it, because its three years ago. But they said, Sir   And this was a big private meeting of all of the nations, Does that mean if we dont   Because I said, You got to pay your bills. Were protecting you. Youre not paying your bills. Some did, like Poland and some others, but most didnt. Six to eight were current, and we were paying much more than we should have been paying, much more. I mean, its Europe. We got to defend ourself, and there was no guarantee that theyd help us if we ever had a problem. Right Were never going to have a problem. We got so much stuff now. We were depleted. Now we have great  But they said to me, Does this mean   And I had to give this answer. I cant believe it didnt get leaked by some sleazebag. We have leakers all over this place, but a lot of it didnt leak. A lot of it is just made up by the newspapers. They make up phony stories. They say, Donald Trump woke up today. He was in a very bad mood, according to sources. There is no source. They just made it up. Hey, I woke up, and I was in a bad mood. True. Ive actually had a  Ive been in a good mood, because were doing so much for our country. Weve done so much for our country. But at the NATO meeting, one of the presidents of one of the good countries, all good, they said, Sir, does this mean that if we dont pay, does this mean that youre going to leave, and youre not going to protect us I said, Yes. Thats what it means. Im sorry. It was an amazing effect, because other presidents said, No. We will always protect you. We will always protect you, even if you dont pay, even if our taxpayer is paying for everything, even though you take advantage of us on trade, you dont let our cars in, you dont let our stuff in, but you sell us like crazy, even though you tariff our product, even though you do everything, and then you take advantage of us with the military. They said, We will always protect you. So they didnt pay. Why the hell would they pay They said, Boy, these guys are stupid. So they asked me the question, Does this mean, sir, that you will not protect us anymore if we dont pay I said, Im sorry to say, it does. Thats a big story. Three years ago, its a big story. It was amazing how the money came in. So we took in 130 billion a year, going over a three-year period, to 400, just because I asked. Right Just because I asked. True. They dont report that story. Then we got lightweights that I fired, and they write books about me, that Im a bad guy, Oh, hes a terrible guy. He treats our allies so badly. No. Our allies treat us badly. Our allies in many ways treat us worse than our enemies. I must be honest with you. They take advantage of us. Everyone takes advantage of your country, and we dont put up with it. And you know what the funny thing We get along better now, because they respect us again. Before, they thought we were stupid. They respect us again. They do. I mean, look at Israel, look what we did. I saw Kerry this other day. Is this guy the worst negotiator Gave Iran 150 billion, plus 1.8 billion in cash. He never walked. Sometimes in a negotiation, when youve given everything, and you cant give anymore, and then they want more, you get up ane walk. Remember the bicycle accident That was the only time he had to ride his bicycle in a race. 73 years old. I promise, I said, I will never ever  I promise to you, ride a bicycle in a race, or any other time frankly. I will never ride a bicycle during a negotiation. And he broke his leg, and his arm, and he was all screwed up. And that was actually a good thing, because it delayed the signing of that horrible deal, which I terminated. Nah, we had some terrible negotiators, and they all said, I saw them the other day, this was him like a year ago, Mark my words, you will never ever sign deals with Arab countries, with Israel. It cant be done. Well, we just signed the two great ones, and we got about seven more that want to come in. What a bunch, what a bunch. And then they say bad things about your president. They dont like my foreign policy. I like my foreign policy. You like it. No, we were taken advantage of by the whole world. Theyre so stupid, so stupid. Weve spent the last four years reversing the damage that Biden and his crew inflicted on us over a 47-year period. Joe Biden is weak. Hes supported every globalist sellout of North Carolina, the workers, what hes done. And when I say, him, its him and people in his little group that  Youve achieved so much over a period of time. He sold it out. Look at NAFTA. How bad was NAFTA Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization. TPP would have destroyed our car industry. And of course, he joined and wanted to join the Paris Climate Accord. Thats another beauty. That would have cost you trillions and trillions of dollars. That was actually, I think, designed to put us out of business, literally. Biden has repeatedly surrendered your jobs to China and other countries. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA and China disasters. You know that. You lost 43%, but I think the real number is 61%, by the way. Biden says that this an election between Scranton and Park Avenue. By the way, he left Scranton. He likes to say, I was born in Pennsylvania. But he doesnt say he left. His father left. Not his fault, but they make it like hes  No, he went to Delaware. He doesnt leave Delaware, that I can tell you. Every time I see this guy  Wilmington, Delaware. Does he ever leave Im in Los Angeles. Im trying to work on the fires. They ought to do some forest management a little bit maybe. Ridiculous. The floors of the forest, its got 20 years of leaves and trees that are dry as a bone, matchsticks. Forest management. Naturally, this is an election, not between Scranton or wherever it is. Its really between Scranton and China, you know that, Scranton and China. Im with America. Biden is with China. If Biden wins, China wins. If we win, America wins, North Carolina wins, Pennsylvania wins, and the American workers win in every single state. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from this horrible, horrible deal, Trans-Pacific Partnership. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when I ended the NAFTA nightmare. You got hit so hard. All those empty buildings all over the place, but a lot of them now are filled up because of us. They filled up. When did they fill up Over the last three-and-a-half years. I proudly signed a brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement into law, which will bring hundreds of thousands of high paying jobs back to the United States, and its already doing. We invested 2.5 trillion in the US military. Defense spending in North Carolina has soared by more than 1 billion a year. Congratulations, good job. We launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces. This by itself would be a big achievement. This is one of so many different things, Right to Try, the military, the vets, everything. Weve done so much, but we  75 years, right Last one was the Air Force. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Coast Guard, theyre so good. We have another one now, for 75 years, Space Force. We need it. I never even promised that. Right One of them said recently that, Hes actually done more than he promised in the campaign. That means Im probably the only politician in history. They will tell you, these incredible women up here from North Carolina. Stand up. Will you, please These are most incredible people. Thank you. Stand up. Turn around for the cameras, so they can see how incredible you are. Thank you. Man, oh, man. What a life. But we took care of the VA with Veterans Choice. You saw that. What Obama was nothing. It wasnt working, the MISSION Act. Thats amazing. And accountability, where we can fire people in the VA that arent taking great care of our vets, okay Youre fired. Get out. Youre fired. Out. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdad. We took out the worlds number-one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many others, Qasem Soleimani. Hes dead. Hes dead. I withdrew from last administrations disastrous Iran nuclear deal. I kept my promise, recognized the true capitol of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we got it built. I was signing a sheet of paper, youve heard this story, 1.1 billion. I said, Whats this for They said, Sir, now that youve moved, were going to build an embassy in Israel, in Jerusalem. I say, How much is it 1.1 billion. You got some friends of mine here, theyre builders. You dont spend 1.1 billion on a one-story building. I dont know whats going on. So I said, So, does it have to cost so much Yes, sir. Were buying land So I called David Friedman. Hes our ambassador, hes one of the most successful lawyers in New York. Hes a brilliant guy. He loves Israel. Right Love Israel. I call him. Hes the ambassador, hes there. I said, David, they want to spend 1.1 billion on a damn one-story embassy. Its crazy. I said, Would you take a look Maybe we own some land. We own a lot of land. Weve been there a long time. Calls me back. He said, Let me take a look at it, sir. He calls me the next day. Sir, we have a great piece of land, a much better location that we were going to way overpay for, a much bigger piece. We have a setback building that we can renovate and make it great. I said, Thats fantastic, David. How much will it cost to renovate the building I think we can do it for 190,000. So I said, David, its the first time Ive ever done it. I said, David, its too cheap. You got to spend more than that. So a friend of mine, Ron Baron, hes got an office building, and hes got Jerusalem stone facing the elevators in this high-rise building, Jerusalem stone. And every time I go in, he goes, Oh, you got to see Jerusalem stone. And he paid a fortune for it. Hes so proud of it. He doesnt talk about anything but his Jerusalem stone. I said, David, do me a favor. Youre I Jerusalem. Right Yes. Do they have Jerusalem stone They got so much, we dont know what to do with it. I said, Use all Jerusalem stone when youre rebuilding the building, when you do your renovation. Everything, wrap it in Jerusalem stone. So I think we ended up spending, to fix up the building, like 500,000. Can you believe it We were going to spend 1.1 billion, and by the way, it would never get built. It wouldnt be built in 20 years from now. And they like it so much, they gave up the plan. They think this is better. Its a better location, its probably a better building. But I could tell you stories like that all night long, the aircraft carriers that cost 10 times more than they should cost, and then they use the electric catapults. Youve heard that. Right They dont want to use steam. Why Because its too simple, because it works, because its better. So they go to electric catapults that theyre working on for years now. Elevators that are operated my magnets instead of hydraulic. Magnets. It sounds good. Trust me, it doesnt work. One little glass of water. Were in the ocean. One little glass of water, boom, those magnets are gone. I could have told them that. I actually asked the architect,  Have you ever built a ship before Its unbelievable. You heard the story last night about Air Force One. It saved a lot of money. I said to Boeing, No. Its got to have a three in front of it. They were going to buy Air Force One, 5.7 billion. Its a lot of money, but look, its a helluva a deal. Its a helluva a plane. What can I tell you. I said, How much is the new plane It was signed by Obama. 5.7 billion, sir. I said, Thats a lot of money. Its actually two planes. Air Force One is two planes. Ill give you a little. Theyre going to say, Thats classified information. Well, theyve been flying around with two planes for 30 years, so I assume somebody knows. And our Air Force One is 31 years old. Right So, look, its time. A lot of the Arab sheiks come in. I see their plane. They have a brand new one. I say, What do we have 31 years, and were protecting them. Why the hell dont we have a new one So they finally had, at 31 years old. The new one is totally different, 747. Its much longer, bigger wingspan, much more beautiful. Its modern, its beautiful. 5.7 billion. So I said to the head of Boeing, nice guy, Dennis, this was before they had their difficulty, which is terrible what happened to them, but I said to him, Dennis, Im not going to spend 5.7 billion on a plane. Im not going to do it. I wont do it. Its too much. I said last night, I told this story, first time, I said, Its got to have a three on it. He said, We cant do it. No. He called me up the following day, Well take 200 million off. Somebody said, Well, what are you losing I said, Nothing. In fact, were gaining a generator. And I said, You got to build an extra generator. He said, Well take 200 million off. I said, Nope. I said to the general in charge, I said, General, can we break the deal Yes, sir, we can. We have a cancellation clause. Good. General, execute your cancellation clause. Were not going to buy it. Im not going to pay 5.7 billion for Air Force One. Im not doing it. He said, Yes, sir. Im very proud of this clause. Why Why Because we have the right to cancel. Well, do we have to pay anything Yes, sir, 250 million. I said, General, dont cancel it. Take it back. Just tell them we dont like the plane. Okay And I couldnt even say, Im going to buy it from Europe. The only competitor is Europe. I cant say, Well buy it from Europe. No, that doesnt work out to well. So I said, Dont do it. I dont want to send them a check. 250 million for nothing. Right We dont want to do it. So I said, Just tell them, We dont like it. The price is too high. Were not going to buy it. But dont send anything, dont put it in writing. Please, general. Yes, sir. Thank you. So about a week later, the head of Boeing called me up. He said, Look, we can get it down, but youre asking for too much. I said, You dont understand. It has to have a three on it, not a four, but three. So another months goes by. I forgot about it. I get a call from Boeing, Would 3.9 billion be okay I said, Yes, thats okay. Its got a three on it. True. True story. True story, and then somebody said  its true though, somebody said, Well, it must be a different plane. Yeah. I said, Yeah, we have a much nicer paint job. We have a much nicer paint job, you know that, and it actually got an extra generator put on. Okay So its actually more. They said, well, we could use an extra generator. I said, Is there anything else you need They said, Sir, we could use an extra generator. I said, Well get it for you, well get it. So I had it included in the price. These people know exactly what Im talking about. Its called included in the price. But think of it, theres hundreds of deals like that. But youre one person, and thats why I got Mark Meadows involved, because hes from North Carolina. Hes from North Carolina, and hes cheap as hell. I need some cheap people. Oh, theres many, hundreds and hundreds of stories. I could tell you so much. Its crazy. The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy your country. It would destroy your Social Security and protections for preexisting conditions, it will. Hes going to drain your Medicare by giving away our healthcare to illegal immigrants. And I will tell you this, youre going to have socialized medicine. Thats as sure as youre there. And Obama lied 28 times when he said you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. It was a lie. Said it 28 times, that we have, but it was a lie. But now youre really losing your doctor. Youre going to have socialized medicine. Eliminate private healthcare insurance for 180 million Americans who love their healthcare. They have the best in the world. His running mate sponsored the socialist takeover of healthcare. You saw that. He wants to ban private insurance. Youre going to lose  180 million people are going to lose their healthcare under this Biden character, and he has no clue. Theyre going to take it away from him. Theyre going to be running him ragged. Sign this. Sign this. Okay. What is it Doesnt matter. Just sign it, President, right now. Im getting tired. Id like to rest, Id like to let Kamala take over as president. Thats no way to get into the office, because were going to have a woman president someday, but you know what It cant be Kamala. Kamala. Nobody treated him worse, and he picked her. Ill tell you, I was  brilliant forecast. He could never pick her. She called him a racist. Right She talked about Me Too-ing him. He was going to be Me Too-ed. Right Me-Too-ed. A lot of bad things. There was nobody. Think of it, even Pocahontas treated him better. She knocked the hell out of Bloomberg, but she left him sort of alone. I think she felt sorry for him. I heard she felt sorry for him. I dont want people to feel sorry for our president. I want other people, really, to feel sorry for themselves, because we have somebody that knows what theyre doing. We cant have it. We can joke, we can play games, we can have fun. You cant have this guy as your president. You cant have him. Maybe Ill sign an executive order. You cannot have him as your president. No, but you know this. Everybody knows this. And you know what People are going to vote for him because they feel sorry for him. I feel sorry for him too. I feel sorry for him. And maybe hell show up for an hour-and-a-half at a debate. Who the hell knows I dont know. But you know. You see the condition hes in. You cant have him as your president. And you know what You cant have her as your vice president, potentially going to be president. And thats why theyre pushing so hard, because they know hes going to be out very soon, and shes going to take over. And she is the furthest left person of anybody. She is rated, not by me, she is rated further left than even Bernie Sanders. Okay Hes second, shes first. We will hire more police. Thank you, sheriffs. Thank you, sheriffs. I love the sheriffs. We got the endorsement from all the sheriffs in Florida, everybody up in Ohio and Texas. We have the stuff, nobodys ever seen anything like it, the endorsements from law enforcement. Were going to increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defeat everybody that we have to, including the virus, but we will defend the dignity of work, and we will defend the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep  You know this, right Its okay, right We will keep America out of these ridiculous foreign wars. We will maintain Americans unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. Its about time. We will end surprise medical bills, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs, which were doing an unbelievable job on, other than the fact that the drug companies are spending a fortune, because they dont like me much. You will see drug prices, prescription drugs, dropping 50, 60, 70% in a very short period of time. Favored nations clauses. We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. You have to see what weve done with NASA. Well be the first one on Mars, I hope. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriot education to our schools, patriotic education. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, and we will never change it, by the way. We will never change it. They took the word, God, out of the Pledge of Allegiance twice. I said, Did they make a mistake. Did they make a mistake. They didnt for them. They made a mistake for us. Were not going to put up with it. But we will keep, In God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina. This is the most important election weve ever had. Remember it. Were going to be a socialist country. Were going to be a communist country. These people are further  theyre much further left than socialism. These people are sick. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote. Get out and vote. And watch to make sure theyre not cheating, which they will be. Early voting has already begun. Dont wait. Get out and vote. We got to win this. If we win this state, were going to win the whole thing. This is a very important state. If we win North Carolina, were going to win the whole thing, because were doing well everywhere, from Wilmington to Charlotte, from Concord to Raleigh, and from Greensboro to right here in Fayetteville. We inherit the legacy of generations of North Carolina patriots, who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country. And together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, with your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. You hear that, General We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will America strong again, we will make America proud again. We will America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Get out and vote, vote, vote, vote."

Thank you. And Prime Minister Modi is doing a truly exceptional job for India and for all of the Indian people. It is my immense privilege to be here with him today at this profoundly historic event. Were especially grateful to be joined by over 50,000 incredible members of our nations thriving, prospering, flourishing, and hardworking Indian American community. Thank you.

We are governed by the rule of law, guided by commitment to justice, and strengthened by our love of liberty. Our two national constitutions both begin with the same three beautiful words, We the People. That means that in America AMD India alike, we honor, respect, trust, empower and fight for the citizens we proudly serve. Under Prime Minister Modis leadership, the world is witnessing a strong sovereign and thriving Republic of India. In a single decade, with the help of Prime Minister Modis pro-growth reforms, India has lifted nearly 300 million people out of poverty and that is an incredible number. Incredible. Thats incredible. In the next decade, 140 million Indian households will rise to the middle class. In both India and the United States, were seeing something really remarkable. Our people are prospering like never before because we are slashing bureaucracy and cutting job killing red tape. In the United States, thanks to our massive tax cuts and all of our great senators and congressmen and women that are here today and pro worker policies, our economy is breaking one record after another. Since my election, we have created over 6 million new jobs. We have created over 750,000 jobs right here in Texas and very importantly, that includes 70,000 new Texas manufacturing jobs. They said that couldnt be done. Unemployment  Think of this. Unemployment in Texas is currently at the lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country, and unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years and very soon we think that will be broken to be a historic number. Unemployment among African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans have all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country. Over the last two years, the unemployment rate among Indian Americans dropped by nearly 33 and one third percent. Wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and inequality is falling at the fastest rate in many, many years. In the past 12 months alone, the average worker has taken home 1,000 extra in rising wages and over 3,000 with tax cuts and all of the other things that weve done. And for the first time in history, most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women. First time thats ever happened. Through our pledge to Americas workers, we have secured commitments for nearly 14 million employment and training opportunities for American workers done through our great American companies. We passed the biggest tax cuts and the biggest tax reforms in the history of our country. We slashed a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household more than 3,000 every year and never in the history of our country, no matter how long the presidency, have regulations been cut to this extent. Everyday, the Indian American community is helping to strengthen our country and build our future. Indian Americans are pioneering groundbreaking medicines to save countless lives. Theyre developing revolutionary technology that is changing the world and theyre founding new businesses that provide jobs to thousands of our fellow citizens. Prime Minister Modi, I look forward to working with you to make our nations even more prosperous than ever before. And thats whats happening. The economic miracles taking place today are just beginning. Here in the United States, there has never been a better time to hire, invest, grow, and pursue your dreams. Indian companies employ tens of thousands of Americans across a range of industries, including American steel. In 2018 Indias JSW Steel announced that it would invest up to 500 million to revitalize a shuttered steel plant in the great state of Ohio. And we welcome Indias growing investments right here in the Lone Star State. Nations around the world are investing in the United States because they know we have the best economy and the best workers in the world. They have never invested in our country like they are today. And we want to thank everybody and India has never invested in the United States like it is doing today. And I want to say its reciprocal because were doing the same thing in India. On Tuesday, two Japanese companies, Toyota and Aisin, announced a combined investment of almost 800 million, which will create over 900 new jobs right here in Texas. At the same time, we are working to expand American exports to India, one of the worlds fastest growing markets. We are committed to ensuring the Indian people have access to the finest goods in the world, product stamped with a beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. And very soon, India will have access to another world class American product, NBA basketball. Wow, sounds good. That sounds good. Next week thousands of people will gather in Mumbai to watch the first ever NBA basketball game in India. Am I invited, Mr. Prime Minister I may come. Be careful. I may come. When it comes to expanding our commercial relationship, no issue is more important than energy security. For the first time ever, the United States is the number one producer of both oil and natural gas on planet earth and number one by far, with much of it coming right here from the great state of Texas. That means more jobs, higher wages, and lower prices at the pump. Yesterday, we were thrilled to hear about the Indian company Petronas pledge to purchase up to 5 million tons of LNG per year from the United States, which could lead to billions of dollars of LNG exports to India in the coming years. And we have plenty of it. Over the last year, crude exports to India have grown by 400% and liquefied natural gas exports continue to soar at record numbers. Thank you. These tremendous exports not only expand employment in America, but they increase freedom and security for India. To keep our nation safe, the United States and India forging an even stronger security partnership. US defense sales to India have also reached 18 billion over the past decade. We make the greatest defense mechanisms and equipment anywhere in the world and India knows that well. Were looking forward to concluding several new defense deals very soon. There are a lot of them in the works. Here in America, were creating the United States Space Force and were working closely with India to enhance space cooperation. In November, the United States and India will demonstrate a dramatic progress of our defense relationship, holding the first ever tri-service military exercise between our nations. Its called Tiger Triumph. Good name, its a good name. Very good name. Today, we honor all of the brave American and Indian military service members who work together to safeguard our freedom. We stand proudly in defense of liberty and we are committed to protecting innocent civilians from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Thank you. Both India and the United States also understand that to keep our communities safe, we must protect our borders. Since taking office, my administration has launched a far-reaching effort to improve screening and vetting of applications for entry. We are working hard to ensure that those who would threaten our security are denied admission into our country and we are enhancing our vetting efforts like-  country, and we are enhancing our vetting efforts like never before, not even close. Were doing it on a daily basis, and well soon be setting records in every one of the aspects of border security. Border security is vital to the United States. Border security is vital to India. We understand that. We are further taking unprecedented action to finally secure our southern border and stop illegal immigration. I want to thank the president of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. Its been incredible whats taken place in a short period of time. Illegal immigration is deeply unfair to millions of wonderful legal immigrants who work hard, pay their taxes, follow our rules, and obey our laws. Yet there are those in Washington who would raid your healthcare to  Free benefits. They want to fund free benefits to those who enter our country illegally. We dont want to do that. We dont want to do that. Because if we dont do it, they wont come. I will never allow politicians to take away your healthcare or give it to illegal immigrants. My administration believes our first duty is to the highest loyalty of all. We must always be for the American people, whether its African-American, Hispanic-American, Indian-American. We are going to take care of our citizens first. We are going to take care of our Indian-American citizens before we take care of illegal immigrants that want to pour into our country. We want to build a nation where every family, immigrant and US-born, can live in a safe community with access to great school, work in a job you love, and have the best chance to reach the American dream. We love the American dream. Just in concluding, I want to say that America has always been a nation of pioneers and patriots, risk-takers and free thinkers, and dedicated workers who have honed a trade, mastered their field, and teach their children to always give their very, very best. Every day Indian-Americans help write the story of American greatness, and everyone here today has a crucial part to play in building an even grander and greater American and Indian future. To help achieve that exciting vision, we are strengthening our cherished bonds with the nation of India, and we are proving the awesome power of democracy and unlimited potential of free people. Together, we will continue to deepen the ties between our nations. We will honor the faith of dignity of our citizens, and we will achieve incredible advancements for our people, for our children, and for the world. We will discover new cures and save millions of lives. We will advance cutting-edge technologies and lift millions and millions of people out of poverty. We will pioneer new frontiers in space, working together, raising the sights of humanity. We will uphold our values, defend our liberty, and control our destiny. The United States and India will make our nations stronger, our people wealthier, our dreamers bigger, and our future brighter than ever before, and it wont even be close. I want to thank everybody for being here. I want to especially thank a great man and a great leader, the leader of India, Prime Minister Modi, my friend. Thank you. God bless you all. God bless India, and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you. Now I would like to invite onto this stage in front of this incredible group of unbelievable people Prime Minister Modi, whos going to give us some of his wisdom. His wisdom is indeed great. Thank you all very much. Its been a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you."
Bemidji,Sep18,2020,"Theres a lot of people. Thats great. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thats a big group of people. This is on fast notice, too. Thank you. But Im thrilled to be here with the beautiful, great, hardworking people of this incredible state. Youre really hardworking American patriots. Thats what you are, and a lot of people havent been treated right until I came along. Weve done a lot of work and a lot of good work, and you had your best year ever last year. The state had the best year youve ever had. 46 days from now, were going to win Minnesota, and were going to win four more years in the White House. One of the most vital issues in this election is the subject of refugees. You know it. You know it perhaps better than almost anybody. Lots of luck. Youre having a good time with the refugees. Thats good. We want to have Omar. He said Omar. Thats a beauty. How the hell did she win the election How did she win Its unbelievable. Every family in Minnesota needs to know about sleepy Joe Bidens extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from Somalia, from other places all over the planet. Well, thats whats happened, and you like Omar a lot, dont you Biden has promised a 700% increase in the manifesto with Bernie, right A 700% increase in the importation of refugees from the most dangerous places in the world, including Yemen, Syria, and Somalia. Congratulations, Minnesota. A 700% increase. Good luck, Minnesota. Enjoy yourselves, because if Im not here, if I dont win, I dont know where Im going to be. But maybe Ill come over to see Mike. Ill come and see Mike. Your state will be overrun and destroyed, and Biden and the radical Left win. Thats whats going to happen. Ive been watching it for years. They havent treated you right. They have not treated Minnesota right. Thank you. Ill tell you, these hangers are great. Remember this. Its a friendly protest. Please remember this is not a rally. Youre not allowed to have political rallies of any kind. Youre not allowed to go to church. Youre not allowed to do anything. The only thing youre allowed to do is run wild through the streets, burn down storefronts, blow up stores, and kill people, because thats considered a protest, and that, they allow you to have. You dont have to wear masks at protests. So I said, We cant have a rally. The most we can have is ten people. But why dont we just call it a protest, because this is a protest. Its a protest against stupidity. Speaking about stupidity, sleepy Joe will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp. Think of it. 700% increase. So youre not happy now Look at that guy over there. Hes not too thrilled when he hears this. 700% increase is what they have in the manifesto. Now, maybe they dont honor it, but I would say theyll go substantially higher than that number. Biden will overwhelm your childrens schools, overcrowd their classrooms, and inundate your hospitals. Thats whatll happen. Biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban to jihadist regions, jihadist regions. Theyve already been doing that to you, havent they Opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorists. My administrations keeping terrorists, extremists, and criminals the hell out of our country. We dont want them. We dont want them. Weve got enough of them. Weve got enough of them. Just today, we deported, as you know very well, dozens of Somali nationals charged or convicted with very grave crimes, including rape, assault, robbery, terrorism, and murder, of course. These hardened criminals are back in their country, where they do all the complaining they want, and your children are much safer as a result. Thank you, President Trump. Thank you. If it were up to Biden, and its not. Its the people thats around him. They are seriously radical Left Democrats, and theyre very dangerous. The offenders are very dangerous, and theyd be running all over your state. Only by voting for me are you going to say  But I hate to say this, and get it with your iron ore. I did it with some other things, and Ill do it for you again. Ill do it for you again. But if you vote for me, Im the difference, and Im the wall. You know the wall that were building on the southern border Im your wall between the American Dream and chaos. Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the left wing mob. He has no clue where he is. This is not a sharp guy. Years ago, I said to a certain senator who I was very friendly with, a Democrat, Whos the dumbest senator Whos the smartest senator He gave me a name for the smartest. I said, Whos the dumbest Oh, Joe Biden. You didnt know that That was 25 years ago. That was in prime time. This is no longer prime time for sleepy Joe. They do disinformation. They make things up, and they make commercials. They make things up. Ive never seen anything like it. Everything, they make up. First of all, Im the one protecting your Social Security. They say, Trump  Remember four years ago, they used to say, Oh, Trump will get rid of Social  I have protected your Social Security. Theyre going to destroy your Social Security. Remember Did you ever hear of a man, Fiorello La Guardia Did you ever I dont think that happened with him. New York, I dont think it happened with Rudy Giuliani, did it What a great job Rudy did. You realize Rudys just now really being appreciated. People forgot how good he was as a man. He was a great mayor. We polled it. Id go down about 22 points. They want to poll everything nowadays. I dont believe in polls. They poll everything. But Ali Velshi, I dont know anything about the guy, but I know he was standing there. This is really quite a good scene. Its a friendly protest. Everyones acting  and behind him, the entire city was burning. Its one of the great pictures of all time. The entire city was burning down. That was your city, and its a shame it took so long, but the governor finally did it at least. If you take a look at Portland, the governor cant quite do it. She cant get there. I speak to her all the time. Come on, Governor. I can straighten out Portland. Give me less than an hour. Just let us have it for  because the state has to ask for it. They have to request. Its a shame. Its such a shame. But in your case, we went, and all of a sudden, it was really  That was going to be a bad night, too, right Remember that, about seven oclock Then you see this guy walked out with about a 250,000 outfit on. Thats because it had more computers and this and that. Got the tear gas deal. Hes got the whole deal, pepper spray, got everything, the finest outfit you can buy. Believe me. We just paid for them, and they were very expensive. So we see one, the helmet. How about the helmet with the goggles You can see at night. You can see at day. You can see whenever the hell you want. So theres one. I said, Oh, thats only one guy. Then you see another three, then four. Then you see another ten. They were just getting out of the buses, coming from very friendly territory. He got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas, and he went down. He was down. My knee, my knee. Nobody cared. These guys didnt care. They moved them aside, and they just walked right to  It was the most beautiful thing, and that would be it. But so they had four or five lines. Then they had lines of different  Everybody did the same thing. Did they ever even move one step back I dont think so, right It was just a slow walk right forward. Then they just started walking faster, faster, faster, put a lot of guys in jail, Tom, right Put a lot of guys  Great Congressman, by the way. Put a lot of guys in jail. Great. Not good. Great. They put a lot of guys in jail that night, Tom, and that was the end of it. I dont think he had any problem after that. If you had any flare-ups, well send them in again. But thats all you do. These are Democrat-run disasters. Look at Chicago. Look at Portland. Look at you with Minneapolis. These are disasters. By the way, are they still trying to get rid of your police force in Minneapolis Thats what I heard. See, they never learn. They never learn. They dont  Youve got a lot of people here. Thats a lot of people. I actually like these. We have the arenas. Weve always filled them up. Its been great, and the arenas are good, but usually you have to travel 45 minutes. This thing, you have a hangar. The plane becomes your backstop, right Its like your curtain. Its a curtain. You get a free curtain. Were outside, which actually makes people happy. It even makes the people that sometimes not everybody here likes happy, because outside is better. Its better, and were rounding the turn on COVID, by the way. Our vaccines are coming. A lot of things are happening. Were rounding the turn. Weve done a great job. Weve done a phenomenal job. We dont get credit for that, but well discuss that in a minute. But when you look at it, when you look at it, our country is amazing. Its an amazing country. We love this country, and were not going to let radical Left socialist/communists take over our country. Okay They use the word socialist, and socialists arent great. But communists are a hell of a lot worse, and thats where wed be headed. Were standing in the way of them, this group of people. But you have a lot of groups of people just like this, every place we go. Last night, you know where we were. You saw that it was all over the place, right Thats a big state. Thats a great state. Then I see the fake polls. I just saw a poll here, Minnesota. Im down nine. I dont think so. I mean, I just dont think so. I dont think so, right I dont think so. Its the craziest thing Ive ever seen. This is the craziest thing Ive seen. President Trump is down nine in Minnesota. Now I just saw another plane. See the plane The good thing about these beautiful Air Force Ones, right Thats the smaller version of Air Force One. I think you had a little bit short runway. So they take the smaller to save about 12. No, they took the smaller one. But the great thing about those beautiful planes, they have more televisions than any plane in history. We have televisions in the closet, on the ceilings, on the floors. Ive never seen them on the  We have them all over the place, and Im just coming out. They said, There he is. They said, Its a smattering of people. They called it a smattering. They always do that. Yet Biden with the circles, right The little circles. Hes got like four people in a circle. You know why he does the circles Because he cant draw a crowd. So they put a circle, like hes supposed to  Hes trying to be legitimate. Hes going to go by the science. He always says science. He doesnt know what the word science is. So to have these four or five circles, they put people, that way he doesnt have to be embarrassed when he goes to a high school gymnasium and he has 40, 50 people. They had one not so long ago, and you saw this. He couldnt draw a crowd. It was a big thing. It was his opening or something. Couldnt draw a crowd. So they made it a round table. So he went in. They only had like 32 people. They said, This is very embarrassing, one of his people, and thats what they do. Theyre good. Some of the people surrounding him, theyll say anything and do anything. They said, Lets not make it a speech. Theres nobody here. Lets make it a round table. So these people are sitting at a table. They had no idea, and most of them didnt know anything about politics. They didnt even know why they were there. Now theyre sitting on a round table, and theyre on television. But thats what it is. But they say we had a smattering of people. Yes, smattering of about what 15,000 people in about two days notice. This doesnt include the 10,000 people, Mike, that they turned away. I hate that they turned them away. Youd think with an airport, you wouldnt have to turn anybody away, but they have a certain amount. Then sometimes you have Democrats running an airport, and they dont like all these people here. Thats true. They dont like it. But if were up to Biden, your state would be in ruins. Just take a look at what theyve done, and Im going to hit it hard. They make phony commercials about me, and it gives me the right. How about the worst one of all, the worst Ive ever seen Standing on a grave of a fallen soldier, and then they had some guy, a source said  Theres no source. The source doesnt exist. They make it up, and then they take it. Its called disinformation. Youre not supposed to do that. Im not even sure if he knows. Hes too weak to understand, and hes still weak to control his people. But it allows me to say whatever I want about this guy. The truth is, hes not fit to be your President. Hes not mentally fit. If Bidens elected, extremists, like representative Ilhan Omar  Whatever happened to her You had a great writer who has just made a living off writing about her. Shes done so many criminal acts. Isnt it damn disgraceful that she gets away with it I have to say to myself, I say, How the hell did she get away with that If we do one  Look at General Flynn. He didnt even lie. They said he didnt lie, right Hes gone through hell. Hes gone through hell. This guy wrote page after page of criminal acts. Well, lets see what happens. Who the hell knows But between her and how about AOC AOC- AOC is running a campaign against the guy that was supposed to be speaker of the house. Right Joe Crowley. I knew him a little bit. I asked him once I said, Are you campaigning against this maniac He said, No, shes just a young girl. No problem. I called him on election night. Nah, I was going to, I was going to say, How did that work out, Joe That didnt work. He was going to be Speaker Of The House. Hes got a certain talent. But you know she had no money, nothing. And all of a sudden she had 2,000,000 and she spent the 2,000,000 all over the place. Her and her boyfriend. Whatever happened to her Can you imagine if Id do that You have to look at that. She spent the 2,000,000 and big story. But that was it. Thats one quick story. Oh man. Probably the guy who wrote the story, lost his job at the New York Times. Right Hes now unemployed, but theres a big story. She spent 2,000,000 on bullshit. If a Republican did that theyd be in jail. You know that. Its a different standard and its a disgrace. And our guys better get on the ball. Look, let me tell you how about yesterday. They were talking about Russia, Russia, Russia. Again, here we go with the Russia. Theres never been anybody so tough on Russia with the sanctions. Remember Obama would send pillows. I sent tank busters right to Ukraine. Im the one that exposed the pipeline with Germany. Germany pays them billions and billions of dollars. And then were supposed to protect Germany from Russia. I said, How does that work How does that work Youre spending billions of dollars for energy to Russia. Its all okay. Im the one that exposed it. What Ive done  Hey, they dont want me to go. But if you look, they dont want me to win. Russia doesnt want  Maybe North Korea does because I actually have a very good relationship with him. And speaking of North Korea and you know, its okay to have really. You dont have to go to wars. We dont have to lose our great soldiers. Its good. If I got along with Putin. Somebody said He gets along well with Putin. Im saying to myself, But isnt that sort of a good thing Is that bad. He gets along with Putin. Thats a bad thing. But you saw the head of the FBI yesterday started going Russia. Russia is looking at our election. Russia. Here we go again. Russia, Russia, Russia. I said, What about China What about North Korea What about Iran What about   They dont mention anybody else. The narrative seems to be Russia. Millions of phone calls made not one to Russia. Millions of phone calls received not one to Russia. Then he goes, Russia, Russia. Then they asked him about Antifa. What do you think about Antifa Well, its an ideology. I said, No, its not. Its a bunch of thugs and anarchists that are being funded by somebody and find out who the somebody is. Its unbelievable. Unbelievable when you look at this stuff. But seriously, take a look at the AOC. I call it AOC plus three. Her three people that she tells what to do. And 2,000,000. Dresses, rent, other things. Youre not supposed to do that. Mr. Congressman, are you allowed to do that Sir You dont do that. You dont buy dresses do you If he does thats the end of his career right No. But its terrible. Right John Its terrible. Will prosecute him. I mean, why not I dont understand it. Ill tell you what. One friend of mine, very sophisticated guy, very successful guy called me up. He says, You know. From the day you came down the escalator with our great First Lady, our future First Lady. He said From that day the people love her. She gave a great speech at the Republican National Convention at The White House. She gave a great speech. But said From the day you came down the escalator with our First Lady. From the single day youve been under investigation. Youve been under investigation by sleazebags. People that now we caught, cleaned up their phones. Youre not allowed to do that. Right Mr.. Congressman My great hockey player. Youre the greatest. Right But youre not allowed to do that. You know We want their phones. Oh, here they are. Oh, by the way, they happen to be totally deleted. Like Hillary with the 33,000 emails she deleted. If she is, shes not getting her money worth. Her yoga lessons and her daughters wedding. Right So it was about the wedding and the yoga lessons. So I said, Okay, lets give her five or six each. What do you think, Mike Five or six each. Five for the wedding. Make it 30. Make it a hundred. Make it a thousand. A thousand for the wedding. And for the yoga, lets give her 200. Okay. What about all those thousands and thousands of emails. Probably classified. So Congress  So forget about it. Lets assume theyre gone because she deleted them and then she acid washed them. And then she hit her phones with a hammer. I get rid of phones. Ive never hit him with a hammer. Not even as President. I say, Yeah. Throw the phone away. No, no. Ive never hit a phone. Has anybody ever gotten rid of your phone and taken a hammer and wiped the hell out of it I dont think so. So she gets a subpoena from the U S Congress. Not in a lawsuit against some guy that hates you and youre fighting and youre fighting or something. By the way you do that, youve got problems in court, big problems. But she gets a subpoena from Congress. U.S. subpoena, the most important subpoena you can get. They get the subpoena. And after she gets the subpoena, by a few days everything is deleted. Her phones are busted up and cleaned and wiped. And everythings gone. And nothing happens to her. Forget about what was on. Now think of how angry it makes me when I see it. Now how angry Could you imagine if Id do that its a whole different ball game. Know how angry it makes me when I see it. And we had an attorney general that didnt have a clue. That was my fault. I was loyal to somebody. Endorsed me early. You know whey he endorsed me Because I went to Mobile, Alabama. We had 55,000 people show up at a stadium. He said, Id like to endorse you. Then after we won, he said, Id love to be attorney general. And I said, No, I dont think so. But after four or five times asking, Im a loyal person and I did it. The mistakes sometimes you make is because of loyalty, but thats okay. But allowed her to get away with that is a disgrace. Maybe theres something they can do. So forget about looking for the emails. And they are available. And I guarantee theyre in the State Department. I guarantee you theyre in the state department that ought to damn well find them. Theyre being protected in the State Department. But forget about that. Almost as good is the fact that youre not allowed to do what she did and her lawyers should pay, Kendall should pay, equal consequence. Equal consequence. Equal. But thats the way it is. But we are making a lot of progress if you see whats going on. I said to myself, Im going to stay uninvolved. I dont have to. Chief Law Enforcement Officer, can you believe it But I think its better if I stay uninvolved. And I have stayed uninvolved and we do have an excellent Attorney General. Bill Barr. And Ill be honest, hes a smart guy. I think hes getting tougher and tougher and tougher every day. I think hes not going to put up with this stuff. I dont think. And you know hes got a lot of people that are deep staters, whatever you want to call them. They fight him at every turn. They fight him, fight him, fight him. But hes getting tougher and tougher. I watched over the last three days, Im saying, Wow, thats sort of what were all waiting for. Right But she deletes her emails. AOC gets rid of 2,000, 000. Gets rid of it. Nothing happens. Nothing happens. And then she goes around and calls us all like what the hell are we And she controls Nancy Pelosi. Actually Nancy Pelosi would love to get rid of her I think. How about Pelosi Pelosi goes out and says, You know. I think I have my hair done. So she goes out and she goes into this beauty parlor. I told the story in Wisconsin last night. By the way, we had that great crowd in Wisconsin. You have a feeling about places. You know the problem with Minnesota is that I think since 1972, this hasnt been won by a Republican. So, youre a little behind the eight ball when you hear that. Right I mean, I can understand. And Wisconsin rarely. But I won Wisconsin. Unlike Minnesota thank you very much. Thank you very much, Tom. Thank you. Unlike Minnesota. But its my fault. So I had one speech left. It started at one in the morning. I went to Michigan, we won Michigan. That was another one. Great state. We brought back so many auto companies into Michigan. We brought them back. But I had one. It was already voting day. It was election day. Because by the time I got there it was just scheduled. Had I made that one damn stop to your state we would have won Minnesota. I lost by what A half a point. Half a point. But I get off the plane and they said, Hes in Minnesota. Hes down nine. The recent poll. Down nine. I believe its a suppression poll. And you know, I have an instinct about things pretty much. Somebody said Trump has the greatest political instincts of the last 100 years. One of my enemies said that. And I said, No, I dont. I dont believe I do. I think I have lousy political instincts. But what am I going to tell you Let me just say they said that. And I was very impressed by the statement. In fact, I went to my wife I said, You know, they say I have the greatest political instincts in over a hundred years. And I said, But I dont believe it. I dont. I dont want to be Beto. Remember Beto I was born to run for president. That was the end of his career. Beto ORourke whos in charge of guns. By the way, hes going to take your guns away. You know that, right Biden. Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe is going to take your guns away. Remember Beto on the cover of a really crummy magazine. I wont mention the name. Theyve got a lot of bad magazines out there. The good news is most of them are dying. If not all of them. But Beto ORourke, he did the story and he was going to defeat Ted Cruz. He was going to do all these things. Ted beat him. And I helped a lot too. I was with Ted all the way. And I think Teds appreciated it. But I even said, Im putting Ted Cruz as one of the people for the Supreme Court. Right And you know why I did it You know why I did it Because I wanted to make sure that I had somebody on a list we had about 45 unbelievable people, unbelievable. The smartest, the best. The absolute creme de la creme, right The best minds in the country. Conservative. They believe in the constitution. Little things like that. But I said, You know. I have to have somebody that were going to make sure we get approved. And the only one I could think of is Ted, because hes going to get 50 Republican votes and hes going to get 50 Democrat votes. Theyll do anything to get them out of the Senate. Right So anyway, but just to finish, theres no way that Im nine points down. I look at a crowd. So they say instinct, right So I look at a crowd and whether I have good instinct or not, this is not the crowd of somebody thats going to finish second in the state to a Sleepy Joe. Finish second to a guy that cannot put two sentences together. Now it is an ideology. It doesnt matter. I could put that broken piece of wood right there. I could put that out. And its the same thing as Joe. Its just an ideology. Its just an idea. Now, historically, we have the biggest gap in enthusiasm of any campaign that theyve ever opposed. You heard that. Like 36 points. In other words, theyve got no enthusiasm for him. I have tremendous enthusiasm as we can tell. But he does have enthusiasm to beat Trump. His only enthusiasm is put anybody in there. Right Put anybody in there. He does have enthusiasm to beat Trump. Nothing for him, but to beat Trump. Okay. But historically that never wins. When somebody has to rely on winning because of somebody as opposed to winning because people love you, people respect you  And Sean Hannity did something the other night. He said to this man, If you owned a McDonalds hamburger stand in a reasonably busy area, would you have Joe Biden running that stand The answer is no. He doesnt have the energy. He doesnt. So he cant run the country. No, seriously. I thought it was good. I never thought of it. You wouldnt have him running your business. You wouldnt have him running a McDonalds. I have to say or a Wendys. I have a friend he owns Wendys. He always gets up. Ken, you havent mentioned Wendys Okay. But you know you wouldnt do it because he couldnt do it. And yet hes running for the presidency. Hes got no energy. I made a comment that somebody had low energy. That was the end of his political career. But Joes energy is far lower. Its far lower. No, its far lower than Jeb. Jeb was on the low side. But Joe, hes off the scale. Right Joes got nothing going. Today Biden delivered remarks, barely, to a union after spending 47 years giving their jobs to China and foreign countries in exchange for campaign cash. How about his statement Hey, we talk about AOC being crooked. Shes a hundred percent crooked. Okay. But were talking about that. Look at Omar. She came in here. Did she marry her brother Wheres that writer That writer should be given the Pulitzer prize. He never will be. He should be though. You know the amazing thing, all of these writers, New York Times, Washington Post, right Russia, Russia, Russia. Trump. Russia, Russia, Russia. I had 19 people. All brilliant. All radical left. All Hillary people. Actually not even a never Trumper from Bush. Okay. All Hillary Clinton people mostly, almost everyone. They were all Democrats. How about this Youre being investigated by 19 Democrats that are smart people. Okay Smart people. So my friend says, You know, you are the most honest person in the world. And youve taken three years of total investigation. You dont think theyve gone over my taxes. They went over at the biggest tax firm in the country. The most prestigious. They went over everything. They spend 48 million as it comes out now. Its about 48,000,000 investigating me before I won and after I won. And we caught them spying on my campaign. Thats what they were really doing. And now with the phones, I think theres like 22 or 24 people. You heard this one They said, No, no, no. We made a mistake when we deleted our phone. You know what they had to do to make that mistake Like 19 different formulas. Right I dont even know how you delete a phone. I didnt know you could do it. But they all made the exact same mistake. Thats not good. Thats not good. So lets see what happens to them. Its a criminal act you know that, right Its a criminal act. Its criminal. Weissmans a bad guy. Put a lot of people in jail that shouldnt be in jail, Weissman. Hes a bad guy. Hes on CNN all the time or MSNBC which I call it MSDNC. Because its the same thing. Owned by a company called Concast. Did anyone ever hear  With an N, not an M. Con like a con job. Concast. They a fortune on public relations. Comcast has delivered you the news, all the news. And they spend a fortune. And then I go up and make one speech and I call them Concast And thats the end of the PR for the year. They are a bad group of people. Theyre sick. I mean, theyre sick people. Theyre sick and evil people and they want bad things for our country and they dont report the news. You know, in the old days, when you used public airways free, you had to get a license. I keep saying, If theyre reporting fake news, how come they can keep getting a license Whether its ABC, whether its NBC, CBS, or of course, CNN. Which is I mean one of the great jokes of all time, CNN. Or MSDNC. But theyre cable so I guess theres a different standard. But when youre using the public airwaves free. Okay Free. Arent you supposed to get licensed So I asked my people that. I ask a couple of guys and I never really get an answer. I just want to know a simple question. Do you have to report the truth when you using free airwaves and making a fortune with commercials and everything else. And I never get the right answer because there are people down deep. Its crazy. But were getting down to all of it. A lot of progress has been made. I think youre starting to see it. Were trying to beat a terrible group of deep state people. You know I came to Washington  Think of it, think of it. I came to Washington and I had 24 years of putting people in office. And then you can probably add another four to that. And another four to that. I had many, many years, decades of people putting  So I came. Been to Washington I guess 17 times I never stayed over. Right Never slept over. I was there 17 times. But were riding down the beautiful Pennsylvania Avenue. And I look outside at those police. I love our police. Weve got to treat our police better. I had everything. I had police. I had military. I had soldiers. I had everything you could possibly have. You never saw so much how power and strength and beauty. The beauty. And they were so proud. Theyre all saluting, theyre so proud. Theyre happy to have gotten rid of that crowd that was there before us. Theyre proud. Theyre great. The police. You know, every single police force I think endorsed me. I got the one yesterday from Chicago. Thats not easy. Chicago endorsed me. New Yorks finest endorsed me. Florida. Ohio. I mean, everybody. I dont know that hes gotten one vote. Then he says he cant mention the words law and order. Can you believe it And then I get to the most beautiful house in the world. I can have Mar-a-Largo and all of them. But Ill tell you The White House is still The White House, no matter how you do it. And I get to this gorgeous, beautiful place. And Im up at the incredible suite level and theres Abraham Lincolns suite. Its called the Lincoln bedroom. Remember Clinton used to lease it out to people for money. They never change do they. Remember when Barbara Streisand, shes another beauty, by the way. But remember Barbara Streisand used to stay in that suite Which was the only problem I had with it. But tell me  No, but I do like her voice. I do. I really do. Some of them I dont like even their voices. But she used to stay there. And Im standing in the Lincoln bedroom. The history of the whole thing. The bed, the desk, the Gettysburg address, the beautiful four score and seven years ago. This beautiful Gettysburg address. He wrote it there. And also on his carriage ride up to Gettysburg. He delivered the Gettysburg address and they say the only one that got worse press than I did was Abraham Lincoln. Did anyone ever hear that And I said, No way they got worse. Maybe he got bad. But no way he gets worse. Now people are starting to say, Its probably true. I think youve got the worst. Now they used to say, No, no. Newt Gingrich, great guy. He said, Nope, Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. They were worse to him than anybody. He was a very depressed person. His wife was very depressed. It was a depressed kind of a thing. Hes in a war, hes in a revolution. And he was getting beaten a lot by Robert E. Lee. They want to rip his statue down all over the place. But Robert E. Lee whether you like statues or not, they dont rip statues down anymore. I signed a law. 10 years in jail if they rip them down. But Robert E. Lee won many, many battles in a row and it was supposed to be over in one day. It was supposed to end immediately because the North was too powerful for the South. But it just shows when you have leaders, when you have a great general. And Robert E. Lee, he would have won except for Gettysburg. And that was because his general was killed whos going to lead Gettysburg. Never fight uphill, me boys. Never fight uphill. He heard they were going up hill. Stop them, stop them. But we had no cell phones in that day, right Congressmen No cell phones. So they sent the horses to stop him. Stop him. But it was too late. They fought uphill and they got slaughtered. Thats what happened. But Robert E. Lee these were incredible things. But I hope you appreciate that we had a period of time when they were ripping down all of the statues and monuments. And I said to my people four months ago, I said, This is crazy. These people. And they dont even know. They started ripping down Abraham Lincoln. When they hit Lincoln I said, Wait a minute. This is the man. And you cant do  Then they hit George Washington, Thomas Jefferson. They hit everybody. They even had Gandhi. All Gandhi wanted was one thing. Peace. May we have peace. Rip down the statue we dont like it. I dont think they have any idea what theyre doing. I think theyre just a bunch of thugs. Okay You want to know that I think they are a bunch of thugs. They were going to March on Washington and they were going to rip down a statue of Abraham Lincoln. You know the exact statute. Its up very nicely. Up now. And by the way, they can take them down legally. They go through Congress as a way of doing it. But they didnt want to do it that way. And they were marching on Washington. And I said, Do we have any laws about this They said, No, sir. Now in Congress, the way it is now, the most you get is about a 10 fine. You rip down a 5 million statue and you got a 10 fine. Right Its different world. Thats when it was strong and they had laws. But we told and found this old act. And the old act said, if you rip down a monument or a statue, you get 10 years in prison. They call it prison, not jail, which sounds even worse. I said, Bring that sucker up immediately to the Oval Office because there are a lot of people coming to Washington. They were going to March on the Jefferson Memorial. Do you believe that The Jefferson Memorial. We grow up  The Jefferson Memorial. They were going to March on the Jefferson Memorial. They were going to do damage to our beautiful Jefferson Memorial after Thomas Jefferson. And I did predict that. A friend of mine said, You know, two years ago you said, next will be Robert E. Lee and then comes Washington. And Jefferson and Lincoln. Theyd never stop. The only thing they understand is strength. Remember that. They dont understand weakness. Theres nothing you can do. These really stupid heads of these corporations that give hundreds of millions of dollars. Its like blackmail money, right But these stupid people that run, they get 40,000,000 a year and theyre weak. Okay, theyre weak. But these people, theyre anarchists and the only thing they understand is strength. So I said, Let me see this document. I said, Wow, this is a very strong document. And Derek is here. One of my attorneys, he did a great job. I dont know where the hell Derek is. Hes around here. Actually hes heard this before though. Not quite. Youre getting a very unique speech tonight. You know I mean unlike Joe, I havent even looked at the teleprompter. This guy will Move it up. Move it up. I cant see. Move it up. I havent looked at it. The poor teleprompter guy hes sitting there What do we do Were on line two of the teleprompter. He said, What do we do No, unlike Joe, I have not looked at the teleprompter. Oh, that poor Joe. You know whats the worst part about him looking at the teleprompter The worst part is that means that the fake news media is giving him the questions. Right Like Donna Brazil, who was brilliantly hired by Fox. Fox has changed a little bit. Ladies and gentlemen, Donna Brazil, who was fired by CNN because she cheated and she gave crooked Hillary the questions to the debate. How would you like to be me They give her questions to the debate. And I still won the debate and she had all the questions. Think of it. How do you do that Donna Brazil is, ladies and gentlemen, shes going to work for Fox. Oh, thats great. Thats big difference. Big difference between four years ago and now. A lot of things have changed. But Ill tell you whats changed is the fact that we have more enthusiasm now than we did four years ago. Its amazing right But just to get back to the others. So I signed that wonderful executive order instituting this really tough law. And it says 10 years. It doesnt say, you get 10 years, but you can take it down to three weeks. It says 10 years. So these guys had just gotten there. I had a news conference because I had to let them know about it. Right Weve got many people in jail right now from before nobody even talked about taking statues down. No, but I looked at the Andrew Jackson right With the ropes. And Ill tell you, the police did a great job. And Mark Meadows did a great job. He said, Charge. They charged. And they took these guys out and they were fairly tough. But the police were much tougher. DC police. They did a great job. They were watching and they werent able to do anything. Mark Meadows said Charge. It was like from 200 years ago it was crazy. They charged and theyd beat the hell out of these guys. Or you wouldnt have that great statue on the horse of a great general. He was a great general. And he was a very good president. At least a good president. But he was a great general. The battle of New Orleans. Right He went to jail too. We had all the evidence we needed. Thank you for that. I want to thank you fake news. We called the fake news. We said Can we just have that please When they said, no, we just said, Well take it off TiVo. Thats okay. Dont worry about it. One of the greatest inventions in history. Tivo better than television because television is useless without it. So, we signed it. And all of a sudden these same guys who were watching it, they left. Nobody showed up the next day. Theyre going to have 25,000 people. They had 24 people, 5 of them were brought to prison. Okay. And the next day they said, Well, we were going to save it for Saturday night. And Saturday night nobody showed up. And nobody has showed up in four months to take down a statue. Its true. Because you know why They look and they say, I want to take down that statue. Im going to take down that statue. That statues coming down. And then somebody says, You know its 10 years in jail. They go, Thats too much. Im getting out of here. Its true. Ten years is not acceptable, Mike. Right Ten years is a lot to rip down a statue, have a little fun, especially when they have no idea what theyre ripping down. But we have an idea what theyre ripping down. Theyre ripping down in many cases, greatness. Theyre ripping down our past. Theyre ripping down our history. And thats where these guys begin. They take away your history. You look at the Middle East, you look all over. Look what ISIS did. Look what all of them do. They go down and they rip. They go into museums and they break everything and they rip everything. They want to take away your past. Theyre not taking away the past of the United States of America. Not as long as Im here. What do you want Do you want me to go back on teleprompter anybody Okay. Heres the question. My poor guy must be having a fit. Hes over there. Hes so good at this stuff. Hes on line three.  Good at this stuff. Hes on line three. He said, Sir, should I use turn the sucker off Would you rather go teleprompter or freelance Isnt it nice when you have the option because you have this and you have the option to go either See, Joe doesnt have the option. He doesnt have the option. But if Biden wins, China wins, and its very simple. Its very simple. By contrast, I rescued the Minnesota Iron Range, I did that. Just so you know, O-Biden. I call him O-Biden, its too long to say Obama and Biden, so I just go, O-Biden, because I dont care about Everyone said, Oh no, hes in trouble. Obamas now campaigning. Hey, he campaigned last time harder than Hillary. I said, No, I want him to campaign because he brings out the base. He brings out our base. And Im only here because of him and Joe. Im only here because of him. I could right now be having a very beautiful life of luxury, and here I am at the hangar in Minnesota with 15 or 20 or 25,000 people. And thousands of people that couldnt get in, and Im working my ass off. I could be at home having a good time, wonderful time. But the one thing I said is- We want trump. We want Trump. We want Trump. But I say this. I say this look, I could be home. So home was New York. I had to bail out because it was too crazy, everything has fallen apart. But home, its so sad what the democrats have done to our great New York. Between a governor and a mayor, the crime is through the roof, the corruption is incredible, its a sad thing thats happened to New York. Hopefully itll come back by somebody. Somebody will go in there and do like a Rudy. You know when Rudy took over, it was so bad and they were looking for somebody and they thought he was the guy because he was a tough guy. But somebody has to go in and clean it up. This mayor, he let go of a billion dollars worth of police. He actually believed the nonsense about defunding the police. And theyre all going to do it. Theyre all going to do it. And New York people are going to do it. Im being totally serious now. Youve got to go out and youve got to vote for Trump. You got to break this spell from 1972. You saw Kenosha. What we did for other places, you saw the Kenosha, and that was gone. That was all gone. That place was gone. We sent in the troops, it was incredible what we did, and they did it on day three. Day three is better than two weeks later, like in Minneapolis. But they did it, and weve done a great job and the people of that great state, they understand it, and I just hope the people of your state of Minnesota understand it because we dont have too many more chances with this stuff. We really dont. We dont have the luxury of sitting back and saying, Lets have four years of this maniac, vice president that he picked who treated him worse than any other person. Thats why I say the one person that he wont pick My great instincts, right The one person he wont pick is Kamala because she called him a racist, she tried to me-too him. He was me-tood. Ive just been me-tood Darling, what does that mean But they tried to me-too him. And she was the one that brought it up. Remember Tara She was the one that brought it up, and then he goes, Ladies and gentlemen, Id like to pick Wait a minute, let me get her name here. How do you pronounce it Its with a comma, like a comma, right Like a comma. Remember he couldnt pronounce her name He was saying her name wrong, and she had to interrupt him. No, my name is Kamala. Like comma. I remember that. Like a comma. H1N1, thats right, Joe. Remember that Joe, H1N1. And how bad did he do in that though How about that How bad did he do So come to think of it, hes out there now today. It was pathetic. By the way, did you see the Anderson Cooper thing last night You have to watch. I dont want to watch, but I have an obligation. Im competing against somebody. You dont want to compete and say, Im not going to watch my competition, who wouldnt Its boring, but I got to watch. And he got through it. He met a couple of really The chicken thing was bad. He said chicken many, many times, and it was a little strange that I thought it was over and he pulled it back. He was able to pull it back. But Anderson is a And he interviewed me, hes tough. You know, he can be tough, nothing against him. He could be very tough, but last night he was in rare form. He was, Thank you very much for being here, Mr. Vice President, are you enjoying the run And compare that with my shot, where they asked me about doing ABC with George Stephanopoulos. I think it was great. I think it worked out great. You know what I call it Debate prep. I call that free debate prep. But you know its nasty, its a little nasty that people and I didnt say, No, you got to change the rules. No, give me the questions. I want to use a teleprompter to answer. How about that though Mr. Vice President, Id like to know your feeling on nuclear warfare and how does that relate to China and Russia and where are they in the race Well, you cant have this as your president. I dont care. Forget about me. You cant do this. The importance and the power of this position are too great. You cant do it. Ive learned a lot as president. But one thing I learned is that President Xi of China is sharp. You ever see him standing with the two million men walking in front, everybodys the same height, theyre wearing hats, everyones like a pool table, right And hes standing there by himself, and hes looking like hes not playing games. Theres no games, hes sharp as you can be. And I had a great relationship, but now I feel differently. We made a great trade deal, and now I feel differently. But hes a sharp as you can be. Putin as sharp as you can be. Kim Jong Un, we would have been in a war with North Korea 100%. I asked Obama, Did you ever call him He said that was the toughest problem we had. And we get along. Remember about a month ago, two months ago, they broke into the demilitarized zone and they said, Oh, hes going to attack. I said, No, hes not. Dont worry about it. I got to know him very well. We have a good relationship. People said, He has a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, thats terrible. I said, No, thats good. But you remember it was going to be a nuclear war, and I got along with him. Then they said, Trump made a terrible deal. Hes given so much to North Korea. What did I give I was at like a semi debate with his idiot, a reporter. Hes given a lot to North Korea. What did I give I dont know. Sanctions, sanctions. You took away. No, I didnt. Actually, I increased the sanctions very substantially. What did you give What did I give Tell me. So after about four days they couldnt ask because I gave nothing except I gave heart because I dont want to see people killed on their side either. I dont want to see people killed. Wed win that. Wed win them all. We have the greatest weapons right now ever conceived by man. Weve rebuilt our military to a level that nobody ever thought possible. And then the fake news. And I said that a couple of weeks ago, remember I said, We have created the most powerful weapons known to man. Its true. We have weapons that are so advanced that President Xi, Putin, everybody, were the envy of the world. But they dont know quite what we have, but they know we have stuff that they never even heard of before. And some schmuck back there said, I think hes given away classified information. Now, all Im doing is telling the world, we have the most powerful weapons in the world. Im not even saying what kind. You dont even want to know about it. And God help us if we ever have to use them. But we have the most powerful weapons ever conceived by man. They have the missile, the super-duper, hydro sonic, I call it the super-duper, it goes five times faster than a normal missile, right We have one goes much faster than that. But Russia got that information from the Obama administration. Russia stole that information. You knew that. Russia got the information and they built it. But we have now one thats much faster than that. Thats like a slow missile. Thats like considered a slow missile. But I said it was incredible. Two weeks ago I said, We have the finest, the best, the most incredible, sadly, the most deadly, and we never want to use it, but we have the greatest weapons ever in history by a factor of 10, by a factor of 10. And they went crazy. Hes given away classified. These people are sick. All Im doing is saying that we rebuilt our military 2.5 trillion all built in the USA, every single ounce of it. We have fighter jet, F-35 that are so good, you cant see it. And I went to see the program, and I met some of the pilots and these guys are better looking than Tom Cruise. Theyre tougher. Theyre stronger. Theyre bigger. Theyre more powerful. Theyre smarter. And I like Tom cruise by the way, because you cant get much better than Top Gun, right Great movie. You cant get better. I like Tom cruise. But these guys are better looking than Tom. They got that crew cut, they got the crap under their eyes, they got the whole deal. Theyre smart as hell. So I said, So captain, let me ask you, how good is the F-35 Theyre really good Sir, best plane weve ever had all great. I said, How do you compare that with what Russia has Well, ours is better for a specific reason, Sir. You cant see it. What does that mean Well, when we fight, they cannot see us, that we are so stealth. Now that doesnt mean in three years that it wont be obsolete because thats what happens. Thats the problem with that business. You come up with a new computer and two weeks later its obsolete. Thats why I always like real estate, and grab a piece of real estate. But no, its true. I wouldnt be good in that business. You get to work, work, work, and then youre starting the next one because the last one is gone. Thats why I always talk about walls and wheels. When the Democrats were saying, Walls are old fashioned. Well, theyre right about that. But they work. Remember that All we had to go through in Congress And that wall is going up, think of that. Were building 10 miles a week, 10 miles a week of the top. And our numbers on the border are the best theyve ever been. The best theyve ever been. Well, were building 10 miles of wall a week. Were up to about 330 miles, and well have it finished very soon, and its having a tremendous impact on drugs. Its having a tremendous impact on all of the different things. Human trafficking in women. Its not even children. Theyre trafficking women, its because of the internet. You think of that as almost an ancient kind of a crime, right But its not. Its a very modern crime and its an unbelievably profitable crime. Theyre trafficking women, little bit children, but mostly women. Where theyll put three or four women in the back in the trunk of a car and theyll go through the border. They cant do it anymore. And were catching them. We have people that do nothing but look for the traffickers. To me, the traffickers are the biggest scum of the world. And thank heavens for ICE, and thank heavens for border patrol because these people do a job that you dont want. I know Mike doesnt want it. You wouldnt even be good at it, Mike, hell do a commercial about it. Thats what hell do. Does he have the longest commercials in history I say, Mike Lindell. I say, Mike, the pillow man. I say, Mike is the single greatest purchaser of commercials in history. I want him to buy my commercials. I say, You know, we spent 20 million, I sell like two commercials. He spends 2 and hes got the whole day on Fox. I said, let Mike buy our commercials. Will you I dont know what the hell you do, but whatever it is, you better tell me the secret. Greatest purchaser of commercials. But we have done some job with that. And the traffickers and drugs are way down. Now we got upset with the pandemic, but I watched Biden today talking about, If only Trump moved one week sooner. One week. So lets go, ready So, you know he was against the ban, right Because he didnt think we had a problem. So he was against the ban. He didnt know that China was heavily infected. He doesnt even know where China is, in my opinion. But he was against the ban. These guys write stuff out for him, and he tries to read it. Doesnt do well with it. So he was against it, but now his new thing is, if only I moved one week earlier, but I was earlier than everybody. If you think about it. I had nice guy, Dr. Fauci, I had another nice, got a lot of doctors. They were all telling me, No, no, you dont have to do that. Tom knows that very well. You dont have to do that, Sir. You dont have to do that. You dont have to do that at all. And one of those things, I was very early and I banned and everybody admits that had I not banned highly infected Wuhan province, right Highly infected, we would have had hundreds of thousands of more deaths. And then you had the chart. I put it up yesterday, Im doing these news conferences. Were finally getting the word across that we did a great job, but Im doing news conferences now every day. I call them the highly rated news conferences. And I go before these crazy people, theyre screaming like maniacs. Its not the way they treat Sleepy Joe. Hed melt. If they ever did a number on, this guy would be there hed be laying on the floor crying, Get me out of here, Darling. Where is my wife Get me out of here, please, Darling. Theyre so nasty to me today. What happened We go through it every single day. But you think about it, and he said, If only Trump moved faster, but hes the one that two months later called me xenophobic, and he called me a racist because I was banning China, which was heavily infected. And then he said, Dont ban Europe. Well, I looked at Italy, big problem. I love Italy. I love the people of Italy, but they were heavily infected. France, I looked at France, I looked at Spain, they even had spikes recently. Did you see And were doing great. Were rounding it with or without, but were going to have with, but you know, with his better, but with or without, were rounding that corner, and were rounding it fast and they dont want to give us any credit because they want to keep this up til November 4th. And on November 4th, the press will probably say, lets say something stupid happened. The press will say, I got to admit he did a damn good job. And the other clown will be in office. We did a thing called price transparency. I signed it. Its effective, also very complicated. Its on your medical. And we did price transparency. Its the biggest thing. Its bigger than healthcare. Where you see your prices. You can go now to hospitals, you can price operations, you can price everything. Its a massive thing. The man who did it And I took a lot of heat, and Im doing favorite nations drugs, meaning whatever the lowest in the world is, we have to pay the same. Thats the good news. The bad news is the drug companies, the doctors everybodys angry at me. Actually under price transparency, the good hospitals and the good doctors benefit tremendously, but the bad ones dont, and you have price transparency. And it goes into effect on January 1st. Could you imagine if this sleepy guy gets in and they say like, February, March, April something. They say unbelievable what happened to prices, its dropping like crazy. And theyll say, what a job hes doing this president And Im the one that signed it. I said, could you put it into effect but statutorily It has to mature, mature, mature. So the earliest I could get is January 1st. Its like crazy. You know another one Ill give you another one. Ill give you another one. So Air Force One, so thats the 757, but they have a 747, which is the big Air Force One. I think that just disrespected the people of Minnesota today, they gave us the little one. No, actually its because of the runway. In fact, when we landed, they said, Sir, we have a very short runway, could you please hold on I said, I trust these pilots. By the way, these pilots are the best pilots. When you fly the president of the United States. Wait a minute, hes waving from the window. When you fly the president of the United States, you are the best flyer. They take the best air force guys, they take the best Marines in the helicopters, Marine One. But when youre flying these planes, you can land that sucker, you have no problem. Theres no, mishits. Theres no, Lets go around. I cant quite make it, Sir. These guys are phenomenal. Youve got to see what they look like. Everyones in perfect shape. I look at him, central casting, every one of them theyre great. Thank you fellas. Thank you. But Ill tell you a little story. So Air Force One is a very old plane. Its beautiful, but its an old 747, right Its 31 years old and other people didnt want to do it, but it was time to get a new one. It was time. You got to get a new plane. And actually Air Force One, Ill give you a little secret, its actually two planes. They get two. Its a hell of a way to travel. If ones not working perfect, you use the other one. But they get two. So Air Force One, they negotiated a price and they had it down for 5.7 billion, that was not sounds expensive, and its ridiculous, but that was done by the Obama administration. It was done by the Obama administration. And thats okay. But no administration Obama, Bush, they didnt want to do it because it sounds luxury. But at some point you got to buy a plane for the country. And these Arab countries would have their beautiful 747, 800s, 900s pour in, and they were gorgeous. And believe it or not, the new plane is a much bigger plane. Much bigger wingspan, its a much more beautiful plane, its modern. I think of a 31 years old, Air Force One is 31 years old, the main Air Force One, not this. This is a great plane, but the big one 31 years old. So youre representing the country, but they didnt want to do it because it shows luxury for two planes, in all fairness. Now its very technical, theres a lot of stuff. I wont talk about it because I dont want to give away any classified information. Just trust me, some more sophisticated sucker youve ever seen in your life. I think youre getting into a plane that cost 5.7 billion. Right But its the most sophisticated, two planes. So I said, How much is it A general came, and an air force general, great guy, handsome guy. Theyre all so good looking these people. I said, So general, what are we paying Whats the price  Sir, its 5.7 million and were ready to go, Sir, could you sign it It sounds like a lot of money to me, General, 5.7 million for two airplanes. Can we get a better price No, sir. This was negotiated by the Obama administration. The Obama administration. This was negotiated, Sir, by Barack Hussein Obama. And I said, Oh, thats good. It sounds very high. So heres what Im going to do. Tell Boeing were not taking the plane. We have no interest in, its too much. This is what I did. By the way, this is one of many stories. Isnt this better than going and saying, I saved your Iron Range And I say, But please remember I did this too. And I can do away with this stuff, but I did this too. Please remember that because I have all this list of incredible things Ive done for Minnesota, I wont even touch it because frankly Im tired of repeating what Ive done for all these different states. I mean, I did all this stuff and then I hear Im nine down. I dont believe it by the way, suppression. So I said to the general, I said, General, 5.7 billion, not million, billion. That sounds very high to me general. I bought a lot of planes in my life and a lot of helicopters. I know a lot about it. How could it be five Sir, thats the best price they could get. We only have one day to do it. I said, Cancel it General. Cancel the order. It was signed actually. Yes, Sir. I said, Do you have the right to cancel it Yes, sir. I do. We negotiated a great deal. I said, Oh good. Cancel it. Yes, sir. Im pleased to tell you something, Sir. We have a breakup fee. We made a great deal, Sir. I said, You did Oh, you have a breakup fee. You mean you cant just cancel it for nothing Then cancel it. You dont have to pay a breakup fee. I know about breakup fees. No, Sir, we have a breakup fee. Okay. How much is it Sir, we can break it up for 250 million. I said, Wait a minute. So you mean to tell me that to cancel the order costs 250 million In other words, we give them 250 million, we get nothing. I said, General, dont cancel the order. Just tell him Im very unhappy. This is what these guys. Theyre good businessmen, by the way. These guys, right here, Mike, they might be better than you. I dont even know. He may be the next governor. Mike Landell, maybe you should run. You should run. He is my complete and total investment. You should run. Hed be a hell of a governor. At least, you know one thing. Minnesota would be well promoted. Mike, run for governor, please. So he says, Its 250 million. Its 250, Sir, Im so proud of that. I said, You may be proud, but Im not. So I said, General, dont give them notice because I dont want to write a check for 250 and getting nothing. I dont think I could explain that to the American public. So tell them youre really unhappy, were not going to make the deal, but just do it verbally. And, Yes, sir. And then I spoke to the head of Boeing, a very nice guy. They had some rough times since then. They had a couple of really bad things happen. Terrible, really terrible. This was early on before the problems that they had. But he is, hes a high quality guy. And I said to him, Dennis, we have to start it with a Its got to have a three on the front of it. What do I know I just know that if theyre 5.7, and if I do something with a three. He said, No, I can bring it down to 5.5 billion. So I say, Well, thats not bad. I save 200 million in about a minute and a half phone call. So so far Im not good, but its not good enough. Im not happy. I said, No, we got to really think about canceling it. And I cant go to Airbus, which is made in Europe. Its a little hard, I got to go to their competitor. I cant say Im going to buy the Air Force One from a European company that doesnt work too well. My only option was to say, Look, I just dont want to just put it aside. He calls me up a few days later. Well, we can do a little bit better than that. I said, Dennis, has to have a three in front of it, Dennis. Got to have a three. Like a three, three anything, but got to have a three in front of it. So he said, No, no, no. After one month, we signed a contract for 3.9 billion. Same exact one. Actually slightly better, we got an extra generator. And then Boeing came to me, and I love to negotiate. I do. Got that from my father. My father was a good negotiator and I love to negotiate. So they came to me, Sir, we can put an extra stairway. This is the big 747. And remember this is a big, much bigger than the old 747. Sir, it gets very windy up there. I noticed that your hairs blown all over the place. But we can buy a stairwell for the plane. And it comes under, its like a corkscrew right at the bottom of the plane. Youre very high off the ground, big, big thing. And it opens up, and if its raining or windy, youre covered, Sir, because its under the plane. Youre totally sheltered. I said, That sounds great. So its a corkscrew stairwell. I said, How much is that general 50. I said, 50, what a deal, So for 50,000 I can get a stairway No, sir. 50 million. I said, Forget about the stairwell. Forget it. He said 50. I really thought he meant 50,000. So these are just some little stories. I guess I must like Minnesota to go on one of these deals. But boy, did you get your moneys worth tonight Is anybody having a bad time Did you get your moneys worth Because youve heard the other one. Weve done this, and weve cut your taxes, and we built up the military bigger and better. And were the number one in history in regulation cuts, which is the biggest thing. And the judges, which weve done at a level like nobodys ever done, everything weve done. Nobody has done more in three and a half years, no administration three and a half. Those first three and a half years, nobody even comes close. And you know, its a funny thing. I say it all the time. Ive been saying it for a long time and the fake news, nobody even questions me about it. And you know if I was wrong, they would, but they cant question me because when you see right to try, we took care of our vets. We just got a 91% approval rating from the vets 91. Its never happened before. We got choice approved, we got accountability approved, drugs are way down. Weve got a little setback with this whole situation where these shutdowns cause a lot of problems with drugs, a lot of everything, but drugs were way down. We had our best year in the history of our country last year. And were going to have a better year coming up. Thats why you have an obligation to vote for the guy that got you there. And remember this, and I really appreciate this, thank you. But I appreciate this because nine democrat mayors of cities in the Iron Range have endorsed me over Sleepy Joe. What do you like better Sleepy Joe or Slow Joe Whats better Lets do a poll. We do a poll. We do a poll. I do free falls. You know, these polls, they charge you a fortune for this stuff. They interviewed three people and then they charge you a million dollars. We interviewed 233 people, I got thousands of people at least for free. What do you like better as nickname Slow Joe or Sleepy Joe So lets go. Wait, Slow Joe first. Okay So just scream if you like it. So you have a choice, Slow Joe, theyre both very appropriate. Slow Joe or Sleepy Joe, ready Slow Joe. I think were going to have a winner here. Sleepy Joe based steel, real crap. It wasnt that, but when you think of it, they wrote it out. You didnt have environmentally the right. Somebody said, Oh, well he got a bit because he was good with negotiating with these other countries. It wasnt that. I opened it up. I signed an order. I signed an executive order because Obama took your Iron Range and Biden took your Iron Range away. And Ill never forget. The day I did it, and Tom was there, a man, I dont know who he is, hes probably in this massive audience, but he came up to me and he was a rough guy and he never cried in his life, including at childbirth. He didnt cry at childbirth, but he was crying. And he said, Sir, you gave our life back to us because Obama took our heart out when he closed up the Iron Range. He said you gave our heart back. Its true. So I just want to thank those cities. When a democrat mayor, and we have now a lot of Now we have additional. So these are democrat politicians and two weeks ago they endorsed us, and its a great thing. Were finding that all over the country. Democrats for Trump. Politicians that got elected as democrats, I dont think they changed their party affiliation, but they endorsed Trump. Theyre all in the Iron Range area. And Larry Cuffe is here. Larry Cuffe. Wheres Larry Where is he Larry, how are you Why did you do that, Larry Thats so nice. I appreciate it. Boy, are you good. I wish you had a mic. He said, Because youre the best candidate we could ever I love this guy. Said youre the best candidate we could ever hope for. Thank you Larry, thats beautiful. I appreciate it. Well do a good job. Were not going to let you down. And theyre doing a good job over there. So dig in, dig in, dig we must, right Its all going because of me. Thats cool, man. Thank you. No, he signed an executive order shutting it down. Just shutting it down. And I hear its got the best iron ore anywhere in the world. Thats what I hear. The quality is the best.  or anywhere in the world. Thats what I hear. The quality is the best. And its like an unlimited amount. Im talking about a little, this is a massive operation with thousands of people and everything else. And for me, it was very easy. Andrea Zupancich, where is she Wheres Andrea Thank you very much. Thats really nice. Im glad that at least you got a good location, right Thats great. I appreciate it very much. Youre all friends I guess. Chris Vreeland, wheres Chris Chris Vreeland. Chris Wheres Chris The mayor Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Chris. Thank you very much. Kathy Brandau. Kathy Brandau. Thank you, Kathy. I hope youre having a good time tonight. Were not going to let you down. You know that. Were open. That sucker is open. Were not closing it. Well, think of this though. If Biden gets in, its closed. He said hes going to close it. How about this guy No fracking. Youre not going to frack. Onstage with all these crazy people and they dont want any energy. They think everythings going to run by wind, which costs you a fortune, about 20 times more than what we have and doesnt work. But think of it, all of these people And they say, What about fracking Fracking is the modern technology. And so they all said, No, no, were all against everyones against fracking. What about you Yes, Im against it too. Now hes against it for months. He gets it, now hes in favor of it. But hes sort of grandfathering it. You know, its a very weak Well, I like to grandfather fracking. If Im a fracker, I dont want to be grandfather. I want to have it or not have it, right He wants to grandfather fracking. Always go with their first statement, okay So I was in Texas two weeks ago, we had crowds. Mike, we had crowds that went from the airplane to the well, to the drilling well, where we went to see a well. And we saved the industry because I got Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut back 10 million barrels. It actually was probably 18. Ended up being, I think, 18.5 million barrels. And it saved the industry. And yet youre still paying very low gasoline prices at the pump, but we saved 10 million jobs. But Im in Texas, and let me tell you, Texas appreciated it because that industry was in deep trouble because all of a sudden with the pandemic, there was no demand. There was nobody driving, there was no demand. Nobody ever saw anything like it. So Im in Texas and I said to the crowd, it was a great crowd, and we must have had a hundred thousand people on the road, on the highways and roadways waving. And they had the most beautiful Trump flags. I wanted to stop, Where did you buy that flag The most beautiful flags of me and our great vice president. Is Mike Pence doing a good job by the way He did such a great he worked 29 hours a day. I mean, this guy works day and night. He worked not the 24. He worked 24 plus least five, okay. This man is a worker and hes a wonderful human being. And when they try it, a guy like Biden that cant carry his jockstrap. When Biden goes, Oh, they should have closed one week earlier, and heres the guy that said I made a mistake when I banned China that nothings going to happen. Its so phony. This politics is a very phony business. I havent been doing it long. I told one of the senators that came in, he came into my office there,  Ive been doing this for 30 years. Ive won many elections, Ive only lost twice in my life. Ive been a Senator for a long time. I know what Im doing, sir. I said, Yeah, and Ive done it for four years. And Ive only won one election, but its for the president of the United States. I remember a certain man on television that didnt like me too much. He said, They put together the greatest field ever assembled, the Republicans, remember 17 plus me. They put together the greatest field of talent ever assembled. I hear Trump wants to come in. Hes not going to do it number one. Number two, if he does, hes just doing it for fun and hell be out by September and then hell go about leading his life, but hes not going to do it. But we dont really need him because this is the greatest single assemblage of talent ever assembled for one party. The greatest talent hes ever seen. And then I did it and just week after week, one out, two out, three out, four out. And then weve done changes. Oh, he said, He cant do it because he doesnt have any experience. But I actually do on the other side. I contributed to politics. I always found it very interesting. So in a certain way, I had a lot of experience probably. Maybe I had too much experience. Thats why I can tell you about AOC. Check out the 2 million please, check it out, check it out. Check out Omar, check out Omar, get to that great writer, he should get Oh, so the New York Times won all these Pulitzer prizes, right I was going to tell you before. All these Pulitzer prizes, these people, and they all got it wrong, right They got for Russia, Russia, Russia. We give the Pulitzer prize. I wont use names. I wont use names, but we give the Pulitzer prize to the New York Times. They got it wrong. We give the Pulitzer prize to the Washington Post and all of these real sleazebags. I have to be honest with you. Very dishonest people, very dishonest. I call it the Amazon Washington Post. He uses that as his lobbyist because he owns the Washington Post. He gets crap that other people wouldnt get, okay. That means its a lobby. Its a lobbyist deal. But they got the prize, right They got the Pulitzer prize. All the guys that got it right, that really got it right, they all got it wrong, totally wrong. And they should return the Pulitzer prize. And Pulitzer association, the committee should ask for those prizes back. They got it all wrong. They were a hundred percent wrong. There was no collusion. They couldnt believe. Remember the day when it was announced after three years, there is no collusion. I could have told them that a day one, they could have saved 48 million dollars. They got the Pulitzer. And then you take guys so many, so many. Solomon, Sara Carter, Bongino. How about Dan Bongino So many, so talented guys. How about that great gentlemen who wrote The Witch Hunt Remember that That was the first, right You know what Im talking about. Hes fantastic. All great. These people should have won the Pulitzer prize. Now I would say Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs and Laura and Tucker. In all fairness, Tucker was very good. Tucker was great, but these are all people that got it right. Now they dont do I guess the Pulitzer prize for that stuff, but they probably should. But these guys all got it right. And all they did was get a lot of money because theyre very successful, and thats okay I guess. But they should give the Pulitzer prize to the people that got it right and they should withdraw from all of those writers, many of whom are back there right now, all of those writers, they should do that. And a candidate for Congress, Michelle Fischbach, whos supposed to be fantastic. And Michelle has my complete and total endorsement. But Jason, youre in good shape, wow. Youre in better shape than these Congressman Jase. By the way, Jason is fantastic and hes doing a fantastic Wheres Michelle Is she there Be careful. Its not worth the broken legs. Look at her. Oh, shes a warrior, I can tell. Come on up. But thanks, Michelle. And they have my complete endorsement. Theyre great people. They love your state. They love our country. So just in conclusion, I want to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. And you probably heard me today. It used to be Puerto Rico did tremendous dollars in medical supplies. And then what happened They made a lot, they did a good job, and Obama Biden destroyed it. They took away the incentive, all of the taxes. And they took away the incentive and Puerto Rico went down a long way. Well get some of that back to Puerto Rico and well get it back for us. Take it away from China. You heard that, yes They took it away. And then people automatically vote. Its like a habit. Will I vote for the Democrat The Democrat was so bad to you. And how bad were the Democrats to Israel We did Jerusalem, right We broke up the Iran deal, right And then they vote for a Democrat. Its out of habit, but I think the habits, were breaking those habits very quickly. But weve helped Puerto Rico and weve really helped If you look at what weve done for Israel, its been incredible. They say nobodys done more. And its my honor. But well hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities, which are a disaster. Well appoint tough on crime prosecutors. We will nominate judges and justices who interpret the constitution as written. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. And thats why the Supreme court is so important. The next president will get one, two, three, or four Supreme court justices. I had two. Many presidents have had none. Theyve had none because theyre there for a long time. They tend to be appointed young. Theyre there for a long time. But the next one well have anywhere from one to four. Think of that. That will totally change when you talk about life, when you talk about second amendment, when you talk about things that are so important to you. Youre going to be stuck for 40 years, 35 years, a long time. So this is going to be the most important election, in my opinion, in the history of our country. You got to get it right. Because if you dont get it right, we will not have a country anymore. Youre not going to have a country. Not as we know it. You wont have a country anymore. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, horrible, endless foreign wars. Countries youve never heard of. Coming home. We will maintain Americas unrivaled military mind, and we will ensure peace through strength. This is what we have now. Peace through strength. Remember what I told you about those weapons, we dont want to use ever, we dont want to use those weapons. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, January 1st. He doesnt even have to do anything now. Ill be so angry if he Theyll say, What a job hes done on transparency, can you believe it And he wont even know what transparency is. And its complex. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. Weve done that already. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And we brought NASA back. NASA, when I got in three and a half years ago, grass was growing through the cracks of the runway. It was over, it was closed. It was nothing. Now its the number one space center in the entire world by a factor of five. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. You know that the Democrat national convention and the pledge of allegiance at a caucus, two of them, not one. I heard the first one, I said, Oh, they mustve made a mistake. They left under God out of the pledge of allegiance. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now they then said, Oh, well we didnt mean that. They meant it. Thats what theyre going to do. Theyre going to take God out of it. Just like I was saying before, Texas, they dont want God, they dont want oil, they dont want guns. I dont think theyre going to do too well in Texas. Do you agree with that I dont think theyre going to do too well in Minnesota either. No, but could you imagine youre campaigning, and it doesnt play too well here, but could you imagine youre in Texas and you have a guy say, No oil, no God, no guns. Oh, I think Im going to vote for Joe Biden, everybody. And then they say, Texas is in play, its a very close I have a friend in Texas. He said, I think youre winning by 15 points. These people are crazy. Texas is in play. They dont want to let you have oil. Think of it. Its unbelievable. Texas is in play. Thats the fake news back there. They said it last time too. Remember Texas, when they say in play, that means its too close to call. Its in play. Too close. Weve heard that for a long time, in play, right Too close to call. And they said it four years ago, Texas is in play. This could be a terrible defeat, losing Texas. Big state, great state. This would be a tremendous defeat. And they said it about Ohio too. I think we won by like nine points. Right They said Ohio is in play. Utahs in play. We won by a lot. Remember we beat a guy named McMuffin. Remember the guy He was going to take the state of Utah. And then he was going to be able to negotiate. But that didnt work out. He came in third. Even Hillary beat him. But they said Texas is in play. And Id go around telling my people, Damn it, Texas is in play, how the hell Every time I go there, I have 35,000 people at the stadium, how could it possibly be in play They said its in play. My people would say, I dont think so. And we had a big Texas rancher. He was on one of the shows. He was wearing a big, beautiful hat. I wish I could wear those hots. It wouldnt work for me too well. I dont think it works for me, right But it worked for him. And he said, I dont know too much about a lot, but I know one thing. Texas is not in play. And this guy is going to win Texas by a hell of a lot of votes. And thats what happened that night, the night of the election. The night of the election, they called the results. Ive been listening for six months, Texas is so close, we cant even imagine it its so close. This is big. And they only call the election immediately if you win in a landslide, its got to be tremendous. And they said, Texas has closed its doors. Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has won the state of Texas. They didnt even say the polls were closed. They forgot to say the polls were closed. I wanted to say. I said, How come I won I called my people, How could I have won It was so close they called it before they even said the doors closed. And I heard from the governor of Texas, great guy, Greg Abbott. I said, How are we doing compared to four years ago We did great four years ago, big, big win. He said, Sir, youre doing much better. But these guys keep saying its in play. Its the same way that Im down nine points in Minnesota. If I lose Minnesota, if I lose Minnesota, Jason, Im going to blame Jason if I lose. Boy, we almost had it last time. But we did the right thing. We went to Michigan, we won Michigan, first time in many, many years, that Michigan was won. Its a great state. For years you had a president who apologized for America. And now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for Minnesota. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote. And you know its starting today in Minnesota. Thats why Im here. It started today. Go out of here. You know what If theyre closed, what the hell time is it now If theyre closed, just stand in line like you do. People were here two days ago trying to get in here. Its crazy. So do the same thing at the voting booth, please. From St. Paul to St. Cloud, from Rochester to Duluth, and from Minneapolis, thank God we still have Minneapolis, to right here, right here with all of you great people, this state was pioneered by men and women who braved the wilderness and the winters to build a better life for themselves and for their families. They were tough and they were strong. You have good genes. You know that, right You have good genes. A lot of its about the genes, isnt it Dont you believe The resource theory you think was so different You have good genes in Minnesota. They didnt have a lot of money. They didnt have a lot of luxury, but they had grit, they had faith, and they had each other. Thats what you have now. You have each other. They were miners and lumberjacks, fishermen and farmers, shipbuilders and shopkeepers. But they all had one thing in common. They loved their families, they loved their countries, and they loved their God. Proud citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, were going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And dont forget, you went through years where you werent winning, right Years and years, they closed down. Even with Obama, he closed that iron. I think he just wanted to get even with you, I dont know. He wasnt good. Not a good Weve knocked out about 84% of the things he did. Then you say, I wonder if he likes me But youre getting used to winning and youre going to see winning like youve never seen before. You had your best year and youre going to win so much. Youve heard this, right I havent said it in a long time because weve been doing a lot of winning, but youre going to win so much. And youre going to send Jason to the US Senate. And youre going to keep winning and winning and winning. Youre going to win on trade, youre going to win on the military. Youre going to win on everything you touch. Minnesota is going to keep on winning and youre going to get tired of winning because Minnesota doesnt want to win all the time. Your football team is going to win in the big 10 they say, right No, we are going to keep on winning in Minnesota. And youre going to get so tired youre going to say, Jason, Jason, please, please Jason, go to the president. See him in the oval office. Stop him from winning. Were winning too much in Minnesota. We cant stand it. Jason, please, please Jason. Stop him from winning so much for Minnesota. We cant take it. Were not used to it because we went through years and years and years where it was tough, right The mayors know that. Thats why they all endorsed the president. And Im going to look at Jason, Im going to say, No, Jason, Im sorry. The people of Minnesota want to win, youre wrong, Jason. They want to win. Were going to keep on going, Jason, were going to keep on winning. And theyre going to be happy as hell, Jason. Get Jason in, hes a great guy. By the way, you have a Senator that hes running against. I wont even mention names. She does nothing, nothing. Nobody even knows who the hell she is. She goes to a meeting the other day, everyones trying to figure out who is she This guy he even looks the role. Central casting, right If you can get the look for free, thats good too. Right But hes going to be fantastic. Tremendous guy, really successful. And he loves your state and he loves our country. So Jason, please knock them out. Knock them out. But youre going to win. Were one movement. Were one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Minnesota, and you know whats going to be operating at strength Because I owe it to these incredible mayors that were so nice to me. That was such a nice thing. And I didnt politick you at all. I never politicked you. I said how nice. And its happening with so many other things. We have other endorsements from police forces that I never asked and all of a sudden theyre coming from very hostile territory. So I just appreciate your being here. And Im saying this for you and Im saying it for all of you. Okay. Thank you. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you Minnesota, thank you."
